\section{Framing}

"Relying on metaphors as the foundation for policy advice can lead to results substantially different from those presumed to be likely... One can get trapped in one's own intellectual web. When years have been spent in the development of a theory with considerable power and elegance, analysts obviously will want to apply this tool to as many situations as possible... Confusing a model with the theory of which it is one representation can limit applicability still further." \cite{ostromGoverningCommonsEvolution2015}

instead use "theoretical pluralism" \cite{turkleEmpathyDiariesMemoir2021}

An anecdote from Jane Jacob's \textit{The Death and Life of Great American Cities} \cite{jacobsDeathLifeGreat2016}:

\blockquote{Consider, for example the orthodox planning reaction to a district called the North End in Boston. This is an old, low-rent area merging into the heavy indsutry of the waterfront, and it is officially considered Boston's wost slum and civic shame... When I saw the Norht End again in 1959, I was amazed at the change. Dozens and dozens of buildings had been rehabilitated... The general street atmosphere of buoyancy, friendliness, and good health was so infectious that I began asking directions of people just for hte fun of getting in on some talk. I had seen a lot of Boston in the past couple of days, most of it sorely distressing, and this struck me, with relief, as the healthiest place in the city... I called a Boston planner I know.

"Why in the world are you down in the North End?" he said, "That's a slum!... It has among the lowest delingquency, disease, and infant mortality rates in the city. It hwas has the lowest ratio of rent to income in the city... the child population is just above average for the city, on the nose. The death rate is low, 8.8 per thousand, against the average city rate of 11.2. The TB death rate is very low, less than 1 per ten thousand, can't understand it, it's lower even than Brookline's. In the old days the North End used to be the city's worst spot for tuberculosis, but all that has changed. Well, they must be strong people. Of course it's a terrible slum"

"You should have more slums like this," I said.}
