\subsection{History and Theory}

Refer to and respond to argument that computational models and systems engineering act predominantly to uphold exisiting power structure, the history of aerospace engineers who think that they can solve violence in urban areas. Use timeline / categories of theories diagram and position this work on it \cite{mazza2017}

Dangers of relying on just one theory, or of using metaphors to enact policies (pg.23-24) \cite{ostromGoverningCommonsEvolution2015} instead use "theoretical pluralism" /cite{turkleEmpathyDiariesMemoir2021}

What to avoid situation of Boston central planners wanting to demolish the North End because they imagine it as a ghetto. \cite{jacobsDeathLifeGreat2016}

\ac{pgis}: Refer to macro-micro framework from Table 2.1, pg.17. What parts this thesis covers and what parts we envision EVDT covering in the long term \cite{jankowskiGISGroupDecision2001}

Respond to critiques of central planning / technocratic efforts by Easterly \cite{easterly2015}

\subsection{Sustainable Development}

Use triangle diagram of sustainability, respond to critique that sustainability has been watered down in meaning "If both the world bank and radical ecologists both believe in it", respond to critique of Sustainable Development Master Plans generated by states, need to be able to translate from one domain to another to avoid one dominating the others \cite{campbellGreenCitiesGrowing2016}

Talk about \acp{mdg} and \acp{sdg}, pull from my previously written articles, also \cite{unitednationsWhoWillBe2013}

Respond to critiques of \acp{mdg}/\acp{sdg} \cite{alstonShipsPassingNight2005, reddyGlobalDevelopmentGoals2008}

%instead of the multiplication.  For example, you could use:

%r & = & 4s + s\\
%r & = & r + r

%Or by xx:
