One of the goals of the \ac{evdt} Framework is to be provide openly available code and data products, enabling their access by a wide audience and their reuse for future projects. This thesis is one part that, providing a guide to the framework and examples of its prior use. This appendix contains links to code repositories and to other \ac{evdt} publications, some of which are referenced throughout the thesis.
