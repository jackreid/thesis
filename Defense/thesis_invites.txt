As y'all are already aware, my doctoral dissertation defense is happening in about a month. More specifically, it's on April 11th, 9am - 11am? 12pm? whenever the committee decides we're done? Anyways, I love all of you and would love to have any or all of you present, either in person or virtually.

The title is "Using Earth Observation-Informed Modeling to Inform Sustainable Development Decision-Making". The basic (oversimplified) gist is that I talk about how we can use satellite images for helping sustainable development in specific communities (like small towns or parts of cities) instead of just doing global environmental monitoring.

Physical location is E14-633. This is the amphitheater-esque lecture hall on the 6th floor of the newer part of the Media Lab. Street address is 75 Amherst St, Cambridge, 02142. If you aren't currently MIT-affiliated, you will need to coordinate with someone who is or just tailgate someone into the building.

If you are planning on coming in person, let me know so I have a general headcount.  


Zoom info is below for virtual attendance. Please don't post it publicly / only forward it to people you trust so the moderator doesn't have to deal with too many trolls.

Oh yeah, and the topic. The title is "Using Earth Observation-Informed Modeling to Inform Sustainable Development Decision-Making". The basic (oversimplified) gist is that I talk about how we can use satellite images for helping sustainable development in specific communities (like small towns or parts of cities) instead of just doing global environmental monitoring.
