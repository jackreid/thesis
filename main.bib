It discloses internal processes, organisational restructuring of the municipality and institutional changes geared to increase effective urban management and resource mobilisation required to implement multiple sector programmes and key projects in several locations in the city like Favela Bairro and Rio Cidade Programmes, The Rio Strategic Plan, etc. It is argued that the formation of interdepartmental working groups for better horizontal articulation of policy making and implementation, the creation of the financial and accounting unit, the decentralisation of authority towards sub-municipality levels, and capacity strengthening of its personnel - among other things - have made a positive impact on the performance of local government. The paper further highlights a significant change towards policies of urban consolidation and revitalisation of declined areas of the city supported by heavy public investments and the effort towards broader civil society involvement in municipal projects. Municipal autonomy, problem-solving and result-oriented type of planning and management and organisational change are some of the lessons pinpointed by the paper for a city of that size and complexity. \textcopyright{} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {National techno-economic pathways to reduce carbon emissions are required for the United Kingdom to meet its decarbonisation obligations as mandated by the Paris Agreement. Analysis using energy systems models indicate that carbon capture and storage is a key technology for the UK to achieve its mitigation targets at lowest cost. There is potential to significantly improve upon the representation of the CO2 storage systems used in these models, but sensitivities of a given reservoir system to future development pathways must be evaluated. To investigate this we generate a range of numerical simulations of CO2 injection into the Bunter Sandstone of the UK Southern North Sea, considered to be one of the most important regional aquifers for CO2 storage. The scenarios investigate the sensitivity of CO2 storage to characteristics of regional development including number of injection sites and target rates of CO2 injection. This enables an evaluation of the impact of a range of deployment possibilities reflecting the range of scenarios that may be explored in an energy system analysis. The results show that limitations in achieving target injection rates are encountered at rates greater than 2 MtCO2/year-site due to local pressure buildup. The areal location of injection sites has minimal impact on the results because the Bunter Sandstone model has good regional connectivity. Rather, the depth of the site is the most important factor controlling limits on CO2 injection due to the relationship between the limiting pressure and the lithostatic pressure gradient. The potential for model simplification is explored by comparison of reservoir simulation with analytical models of average reservoir pressure and near-site pressure. The numerical simulations match average pressure buildup estimated with the ``closed-box'' analytical model of Zhou et al. (2008) over a 50year injection period. The pressure buildup at individual sites is estimated using the Mathias et al. (2011) formulation and compared to the simulation response. Discrepancies in the match are mostly due to the interaction of signals from multiple injection sites and heterogeneous permeability in the numerical simulations. These issues should be the focus of further development of simplified models for CO2 storage in an energy systems analysis framework.},

In order to accurately examine numerous aircraft performance states, a multidisciplinary design model was used, consisting of an open-source 6-DoF flight simulator integrated with a vortex lattice aerodynamics solver and a MATLAB routine for calculation of weights and inertias. The primary impetus for using a flight simulator run in batch mode was to facilitate a global approach for concurrent analysis of aircraft expected performance and availability. Namely, by allowing systematic calculation of performance metrics for differing aircraft states, the relationship between an aircraft's global design variables and its performance and availability may be established. Such an approach allows designers to identify those elements that might drive system loss probability through an analysis of performance changes across system states and their respective sensitivity to design variables.},

Input parameters are subsequently modified on these simulations, using Monte-Carlo methods, to understand how changes in the input parameters affect the spread of results for the simulation. Agent Based simulations are able to produce different output results on each run based on knowledge of the local interactions of the underlying agents and without making any changes to the input parameters. In this paper we compare the influence and effect of variation within these two distinct simulation paradigms and show that the Agent Based simulation of the epidemiological SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered) model is more effective at capturing the natural variation within SIR compared to an equivalent model using System Dynamics with Monte-Carlo simulation. To demonstrate this effect, the SIR model is implemented using both System Dynamics (with Monte-Carlo simulation) and Agent Based Modelling based on previously published empirical data.},

This combination of data sources allows us to build a framework in which the severity of a disease outbreak varies across locations and industries, and across individuals who differ by age, occupation, and preexisting health conditions. We use this framework to analyze the impact of different social distancing policies in the context of the COVID-19 outbreaks across US metropolitan areas. Our results highlight how outcomes vary across areas in relation to the underlying heterogeneity in population density, social network structures, population health, and employment characteristics. We find that policies by which individuals who can work from home continue to do so, or in which schools and firms alternate schedules across different groups of students and employees, can be effective in limiting the health and healthcare costs of the pandemic outbreak while also reducing employment losses.},

A methodology was developed using an autocalibration tool to calibrate a previously developed Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) of Difficult Run in Fairfax, Virginia. Calibration was assisted by use of multi-objective optimization. Results showed a good agreement between simulated and observed data. Simulations of CC for the 2041\textendash 2068 period were developed using dynamically downscaled North American Regional CC Assessment Program models. Washoff loads were used to simulate water quality, and a method was developed to estimate treatment performed in stormwater control measures (SCMs) to assess water quality impacts from CC. CC simulations indicated that annual runoff volume would increase by 6.5\%, while total suspended solids, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus would increase by 7.6\%, 7.1\%, and 8.1\%, respectively. The simulations also indicated that within season variability would increase by a larger percentage. Treatment practices (e.g., bioswale) that were intended to mitigate the negative effects of urban development will need to deal with additional runoff volumes and nutrient loads from CC to achieve the required water quality goals.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a definition of systems thinking for use in a wide variety of disciplines, with particular emphasis on the development and assessment of systems thinking educational efforts. The definition was derived from a review of the systems thinking literature combined with the application of systems thinking to itself. Many different definitions of systems thinking can be found throughout the systems community, but key components of a singular definition can be distilled from the literature. This researcher considered these components both individually and holistically, then proposed a new definition of systems thinking that integrates these components as a system. The definition was tested for fidelity against a System Test and against three widely accepted system archetypes. Systems thinking is widely believed to be critical in handling the complexity facing the world in the coming decades; however, it still resides in the educational margins. In order for this important skill to receive mainstream educational attention, a complete definition is required. Such a definition has not yet been established. This research is an attempt to rectify this deficiency by providing such a definition.},

The approach is demonstrated through a case study from the interregional climate, land-use, and transportation planning process (PAKT) in the \AA lesund region in Norway. The work was performed using focus groups with planning stakeholders over a series of workshops to analyze, design, verify and validate the problem structure. Our study shows that the approach is useful for integrating and operationalizing the SDGs in a planning context. The methodology also brings clarity and structure to planning problems and provides a pedagogical frame to engage stakeholders in co-creative PSS synthesis. Further research is necessary to explore how structured elements may be exploited in PSS synthesis.},

We conclude by observing that to directly inform a plan, regardless of the specific approach taken, exploratory scenarios in urban planning must incorporate stakeholder values and not only rely on expert judgment and analysis.Takeaway for practice: Exploratory scenarios are effective for analyzing uncertainty within a planning process. However, exploratory scenarios can be incorporated into planning practice in different ways, ranging from workshops among experts that aim to cultivate general learning to complex projects that result in highly detailed scenarios and recommendations for plans. Practitioners can draw on the cases we present to inspire planning methods for particular projects, taking into account specific contexts and goals.},

  abstract = {The transformation of the existing urban environment in digital smart cities has become a reality, which aimed to transform daily life activities into automated processes for the ease in human efforts and reduction in effort time. Vision based sensors are commonly used for monitoring cities, which acquire a huge amount of diverse data and store them for further computer vision processing. In this article, we aim to explore whether and how to navigate a vehicle using cost effective means (vision based sensors) in smart cities without using the calibrated sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS). Vehicle localization and navigation require on-board calibrated sensors and reliable GPS link. In an urban environment, these sensors fail to perform well in: indoor environment (tunnels), crowded and congested areas, and severe weather conditions. The most effective technique used for vision based navigation depends on image registration. The challenges of a successful and effective registration are: sufficient illumination in the environment, dominance of static scene over moving objects, high textured ratio to allow apparent motion and necessary scene overlap between consecutive frames. We proposed a novel approach for vehicle navigation based on vision sensors using modified normalized phase correlation. In the proposed approach, the distinction between textured and texture less surface is based on the identification of corresponding features. In this regard, the Gram polynomial basis function is used to remove the Gibbs error problem generated due to peak in the registration process. Similarly, entropy based tensor approximation is used to remove outliers for robust image registration. Experiments performed in real time during test drives show excellent results with respect to estimated position accuracy in comparison with GPS calculated data.},

Although the number of studies have grown significantly, there is still a need for a greater range of studies in more locations and for a wider variety of ecosystems. This review also examines, from an economic perspective, the issues and challenges surrounding estimating the protective benefits of ECEs, as exemplified by some of the recent valuation studies. Recent developments in valuation methods are summarized and critically reviewed. Important challenges remain in valuing coastal ecosystems as a defense against flood damages. The review discusses two of them, such as how protective benefits are subject to spatial variability and dependent on connectivity across ``seascapes.'' These challenges, along with analyzing the multiple benefits of estuarine and coastal ecosystems, are important areas of future research priority.},

More reliable methods instead model the production of the protection service of mangroves and estimate its value in terms of reducing the expected damages or deaths avoided by coastal communities.

  abstract = {Mario Carpo provides a subtle and insightful discussion of the intellectual structures that guide architectural composition and the ways that these structures were transformed by the historic shifts from script to print and from hand-made drawings to mechanically reproduced images. He goes on to suggest that the current shift from print to digital representations will have similarly profound consequences. This is a crucial text for anyone interested in the interrelationships of media and design processes.                 As urban planning moves from a centralized, top-down approach to a decentralized, bottom-up perspective, our conception of urban systems is changing. In Cities and Complexity, Michael Batty offers a comprehensive view of urban dynamics in the context of complexity theory, presenting models that demonstrate how complexity theory can embrace a myriad of processes and elements that combine into organic wholes. He argues that bottom-up processes\textemdash in which the outcomes are always uncertain\textemdash can combine with new forms of geometry associated with fractal patterns and chaotic dynamics to provide theories that are applicable to highly complex systems such as cities.Batty begins with models based on cellular automata (CA), simulating urban dynamics through the local actions of automata. He then introduces agent-based models (ABM), in which agents are mobile and move between locations. These models relate to many scales, from the scale of the street to patterns and structure at the scale of the urban region. Finally, Batty develops applications of all these models to specific urban situations, discussing concepts of criticality, threshold, surprise, novelty, and phase transition in the context of spatial developments. Every theory and model presented in the book is developed through examples that range from the simplified and hypothetical to the actual. Deploying extensive visual, mathematical, and textual material, Cities and Complexity will be read both by urban researchers and by complexity theorists with an interest in new kinds of computational models.Sample chapters and examples from the book, and other related material, can be found at http://www.complexcity.info},

Fishers include inhabitants of islands of the SE Atlantic Forest in Brazil. Data on \textregistered sh landings were collected for different islands, in 1986 and 1989{$\pm$}1990, for species caught, technology used and \textregistered shing time. Fishing spots were marked or re-checked using GPS in 1997{$\pm$}1999. Fishing is per-formed in paddled, motorized canoes or in small boats with set gillnets or hook and line. Marine animals caught vary from place to place and include \textregistered sh, shrimp, squid and crab. Spots used are very stable in time, since they did not change for about 10 years. Among other factors, technology limits the range of access of the \textregistered shers to the spots. An in-formal division of \textregistered shing areas or spots is observed, based on the locality of residence of the \textregistered shers. The mapping and observed division of \textregistered shing spots may be used in local management, helping to control the intrusion of industrial \textregistered shers in artisanal areas. Local rules and discrimination of spot users may be helpful for artisanal \textregistered shers, especially in areas where con\textasciimacron icts with trawlers occur. The observed long-term stability of the use of \textregistered shing spots by artisanal \textregistered shers and con\textasciimacron icts with other users indicate the urgency of considering local rules for conservation purposes in Atlantic Forest coastal areas.},

From this we show that a growing number of sovereign states are acquiring capacity for space based land-cover observations and show how geopolitical patterns of ownership are changing. We discuss how the number of satellites flying at any time has progressed as a function of increased launch rates and mission longevity, and how the spatial resolutions of the data they collect has evolved. The first such satellite was launched by the USA in 1972. Since then government and/or private entities in 33 other sovereign states and geopolitical groups have chosen to finance such missions and 197 individual satellites with a global land-cover observing capacity have been successfully launched. Of these 98 were still operating at the end of 2013. Since the 1970s the number of such missions failing within 3. years of launch has dropped from around 60\% to less than 20\%, the average operational life of a mission has almost tripled, increasing from 3.3. years in the 1970s to 8.6. years (and still lengthening), the average number of satellites launched per-year/per-decade has increased from 2 to 12 and spatial resolution increased from around 80. m to less than 1. m multispectral and less than half a meter for panchromatic; synthetic aperture radar resolution has also fallen, from 25. m in the 1970s to 1. m post 2007. More people in more countries have access to data from global land-cover observing spaceborne missions at a greater range of spatial resolutions than ever before. We provide a compendium of such missions, analyze the changes and shows how innovation, the need for secure data-supply, national pride, falling costs and technological advances may underpin the trends we document.},

Some of these variables pertain to policy measures such as social distancing, quarantines for specific areas, and testing availability. In this paper, I analyze the effect that lockdown and testing policies had on new contagions in Chile, especially focusing on potential heterogeneity given by population characteristics. Leveraging a natural experiment in the determination of early quarantines, I use an Augmented Synthetic Control Method to build counterfactuals for high and lower-income areas that experienced a lockdown during the first two months of the pandemic. I find substantial differences in the impact that quarantine policies had for different populations: While lockdowns were effective in containing and reducing new cases of COVID-19 in higher-income municipalities, I find no significant effect of this measure for lower-income areas. To further explain these results, I test for difference in mobility during quarantine for high and lower-income municipalities, as well as delays in test results and testing availability. These findings are consistent with previous results, showing that differences in the effectiveness of lockdowns could be partially attributed to heterogeneity in quarantine compliance in terms of mobility, as well as differential testing availability for higher and lower-income areas.},

  abstract = {The 2030 Agenda includes 17 overarching Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These are integrated in nature, and a principle of indivisibility should guide their implementation. Yet, the 2030 Agenda itself does not provide guidance on what indivisibility means in practice, how the SDGs interact, or on how to assess these interactions. The fast-emerging field of what could be referred to as SDG interaction studies seeks to provide such guidance, but as of yet there is no general agreement on what it means to take an integrated approach to the SDGs. Hence, navigating the diverse research landscape on SDG interactions might prove challenging. This paper aims to decipher the literature on SDG interactions by providing an overview of the current research, based on a sample of 70 peer-reviewed articles. The review explores four themes in SDG interaction research by mapping: (i) policy challenges typically addressed, (ii) ways in which SDG `interactions' have been conceptualized, (iii) data sources used, and (iv) methods of analysis frequently employed. Research gaps are identified, where perspectives largely missing include policy innovation, and integrated monitoring and evaluation. Further, few studies consider actor interactions, account for geographic spill-overs, analyze SDG indicator interactions, employ participatory methods, or take a whole-systems approach to the 2030 Agenda. Failing to address these gaps could lead to inefficient SDG implementation and delay goal attainment. Another contribution of the paper is a reading guide, proposing a way to decipher the literature along the themes emerging from the review, and offering a structure to code future papers.},

In situ networks are heterogeneously distributed in space, and many river basins and most lakes\textemdash especially in the developing world and in sparsely populated regions\textemdash remain unmonitored. Satellite remote sensing has provided useful complementary observations, but no past or current satellite mission has yet been specifically designed to observe, at the global scale, surface water storage change and fluxes. This is the purpose of the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. SWOT is a collaboration between the (US) National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Centre National d'\'Etudes Spatiales (the French Spatial Agency), the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency, with launch planned in late 2020. SWOT is both a continental hydrology and oceanography mission. However, only the hydrology capabilities of SWOT are discussed here. After a description of the SWOT mission requirements and measurement capabilities, we review the SWOT-related studies concerning land hydrology published to date. Beginning in 2007, studies demonstrated the benefits of SWOT data for river hydrology, both through discharge estimation directly from SWOT measurements and through assimilation of SWOT data into hydrodynamic and hydrology models. A smaller number of studies have also addressed methods for computation of lake and reservoir storage change or have quantified improvements expected from SWOT compared with current knowledge of lake water storage variability. We also briefly review other land hydrology capabilities of SWOT, including those related to transboundary river basins, human water withdrawals and wetland environments. Finally, we discuss additional studies needed before and after the launch of the mission, along with perspectives on a potential successor to SWOT.},

This human hyperconcentration will have significant repercussions in terms of environmental and social impact. Vis-a-vis this substantial change caused by the population growth, technological development, and environmental emergency, the clean technology becomes the dominant model for tomorrow's urban planning.

The need for duplicating the prototypes has consequently the over-exploitation of natural resources, the energy resources and the accumulation of waste. To decrease these problems, the industry increasingly oriented towards virtual prototyping (VP). The paper will start by presenting virtual prototyping like a new model of design that takes account of the economy and the protection of the resources.

Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what `research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.},

This is reflected in the fact that literature reveals an abundance of different and at times contradictory definitions, characteristics, principles and methodological ideas about scenarios. It has been suggested that a pressing need for the future of scenarios is amongst other things, to resolve the confusion over `the definitions and methods of scenarios'. This paper makes a beginning at this need by tracing the origins and growth of scenarios and the subsequent evolution of the various methodologies; a classification of the methodologies into three main schools of techniques is given and the salient features of these schools are compared and contrasted.},

The mean and median values are found to be 4185 and 239 US\$/ha/year respectively. The values of mangrove ecosystem services are highly variable across study sites due to, amongst other factors, the bio-physical characteristics of the site and the socio-economic characteristics of the beneficiaries of ecosystem services. We include explanatory variables in the meta-analysis to account for these influences on estimated mangrove values. A geographic information system (GIS) is used to quantify potentially important spatial variables, including the abundance of mangroves, the population of beneficiaries, and the density of roads in the vicinity of each study site. The meta-analytic value function is used to estimate the change in value of mangrove ecosystem services in Southeast Asia under a baseline scenario of mangrove loss for the period 2000\textendash 2050. The estimated foregone annual benefits in 2050 are US\$ 2.2 billion, with a prediction interval of US\$ 1.6\textendash 2.8 billion.},

The open-access nature and the public-good characteristics of wetlands often result in these regions being undervalued in decisions relating to their use and conservation. There is now a substantial literature on wetland valuation, including two meta-analyses that examine subsets of the available wetland valuation literature. We collected over 190 wetland valuation studies, providing 215 value observations, in order to present a more comprehensive meta-analysis of the valuation literature that includes tropical wetlands (e.g., mangroves), estimates from diverse valuation methodologies, and a broader range of wetland services (e.g., biodiversity value). We also aim for a more comprehensive geographical coverage. We find that socio-economic variables, such as income and population density, that are often omitted from such analyses are important in explaining wetland value. We also assess the prospects for using this analysis for out-of-sample value transfer, and find average transfer errors of 74\%, with just under one-fifth of the transfers showing errors of 10\% or less.},

  abstract = {The General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland are participating and leading an international project in the North Sea Region (NSR) of Europe to plan and deliver prototype e-Navigation services. ACCessibility for Shipping, Efficiency Advantages and Sustainability (ACCSEAS) aims to identify issues which obstruct maritime access to the North Sea, identify solutions, prototype and demonstrate these successful solutions in an e-Navigation test-bed at the North Sea regional level as `proof-of-concept' and to develop a sustainability plan for future e-Navigation provision in the NSR and will look to inform e-Navigation initiative globally The entire process of the implementation of prototype solutions in the e-Navigation test-bed will be supported by training and simulation, so that the test-bed will have aspects of both real-world and simulated implementation. The project is part funded through the European Regional Development Fund's INTERREG IVB NSR initiative. European transport policy provides a shift to seaborne transport, using Short Sea Shipping to avoid road bottle necks to the movement of goods, services and people. This modal shift requires efficient and effective marine navigation services. The NSR, as a maritime hub, is at risk from increased shipping congestion and transport delays, safety issues and pollution/environmental risks that would inhibit the socio-economic development of the NSR. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of offshore installations (such as wind farms) for renewable energy. Globally, there is a trend towards larger bulk cargo and container carrying ships, which operate side-by-side with fishing boats and leisure craft in the same congested waters. Without the innovative services of e-Navigation, berth-to-berth operations may become less efficient. There may be increased risk of collisions and groundings, adversely impacting accessibility of ports and the effectiveness of logistics in the region. Consequences could be severe in terms of reduced economic sustainability, more environmental pollution incidents and the threat to safety-of-life. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) concept of e-Navigation, formally recognised by the EU and the US, provides a potential solution via harmonised, integrated and exchangeable electronic maritime information on-board and ashore. The NSR, as a crossroads of regional and global shipping, is well positioned to benefit from an implementation of e-Navigation that can increase the efficient use of resources, provide better voyage planning and track-keeping and deliver improvements in regional accessibility. ACCSEAS aims to implement and demonstrate e-Navigation systems to alleviate NSR navigation risks. The aim of ACCSEAS is to identify issues which obstruct maritime access to the NSR, identify solutions, pilot and then demonstrate these successful solutions at regional level to develop a strategy for future e-Navigation provision. ACCSEAS builds on findings of previous and currently implemented related European projects and the ACCSEAS partnership includes several partners from those projects, allowing a smooth, efficient coordination between the projects and ensuring work is seamless without overlap. A regional e-Navigation service for the North Sea inherently requires a transnational approach. Improved maritime access can only be achieved by closer co-operation between competent authorities, navigation service providers and maritime stakeholders which encompasses: technology, infrastructure, services and operations within the broad policy, guidance and regulatory frame work of the European Union (EU), the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) and IMO. ACCSEAS is a transnational project that brings together Beneficiaries (including competent navigation authorities from Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom). The North Sea presents unique challenges that will demand unique solutions both at priority locations and at the regional scale. Only through the NSR and the ACCSEAS project specifically, can the maritime administrations in the region be coordinated to address implementation of the e-Navigation solution to accessibility and to integrate with regional research providers, training organisations and suppliers. ACCSEAS produces four types of results and outputs: firstly, a practical test bed (real equipment and infrastructure in the form of e-Navigation prototypes and complementary simulations to test these); secondly, a database of information which demonstrates the effectiveness of the prototypes, primarily in the form of baseline information concerning vessel routes in the NSR and Coverage Maps of the geographical extent in the NSR of e-Navigation services for the prototypes that improve safe and efficient regional accessibility. This information will be stored within an ACCSEAS Geographical Information System (GIS); thirdly, `system of systems engineering' documentation concerning maritime access issues in the NSR, how the e-Navigation Prototypes and Simulations were developed to address these and an assessment of best practices involved in establishing e-Navigation regional solutions; fourthly, analysis of the lessons learned, advice and training needs for practical e-Navigation solutions; with training modules developed from this analysis. By the completion of the project in 2015, the ACCSEAS Partnership will have undertaken all activities to produce validated real world prototypes and simulations (validated by test/demonstrations to satisfy user requirements) including: a ship positioning unit and terrestrial Back-up; ship-to-shore based communications; e-Navigation services on ship and shore. The project should also have put in place a structure for co-ordination of future e-Navigation development across the NSR. The structure will comprise a road map for service expansion and a plan for the sustainability and harmonisation of e-Navigation in NSR. The prototypes, systems engineering lessons and training information will advise the further extension of e-Navigation across the NSR using a sustainability plan and roadmap. The results and outputs will allow the e-Navigation Architecture developed in the NSR by ACCSEAS to be readily ``transferable'' to other EU regions and internationally. To achieve the transferability of outputs and results, ACCSEAS will disseminate information about the project to users, stakeholders, competent authorities, ports, policy and decision makers at national, regional European and International levels.},

The general theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics is reviewed, recognizing differences in interpretation between Prigogine and Schneider and Kay as well as discussing the hypothesis of maximum entropy production. Calculations of exergy gradients in a few cities and settlements, along with measures of anthropogenic heat loss in further cities, support the notion that cities are dissipative structures. The observation that primary energy use per capita increases in Singapore and Hong Kong as they grow is further evidence to support the thermodynamic understanding of the growth of cities, indicative of an increasing rate of entropy production. At the global scale, the strong linear relationship between global urban population and total global energy use, and the distribution of city sizes according to Zipf's law, can be understood as emergent results based on thermodynamics. Parallel results might be derived from models that represent underlying microscale processes, several of which are reviewed. Issues for future research include: development of nonequilibrium thermodynamic models specific to city growth; further study of exergy flows of cities with consistent methodology, including attention to solar energy exchanges in cities; and further exploration of links between thermodynamic and economic models of urban growth.},

A central weakness is the lack of communication between PSS developers (focusing on technical issues) and potential PSS users. Other academic fields such as knowledge management and technological innovation recognised similar bottlenecks years ago. On the basis of methods proposed in these fields, a new process architecture for the development of a PSS is proposed. Through a dialogue in which PSS developers and potential users discuss and use the PSS, existing tools, instruments, and models are refined and improved to be more useful to their potential users. The focus shifts away from the development of a technically more sophisticated support system, towards a process of PSS development which is intertwined with the planning process itself. This process architecture is called mediated planning support (MPS). We explore what can be learned from other academic domains and enquire about the applicability of these findings to PSS development. In Amsterdam the Department of Transport wanted to transform their transportation model into a land-use and transport PSS and their work illustrates how such a process architecture can link PSS developers and users in planning practice. We discuss the concepts behind MPS and use the case of Amsterdam to visualise its workings, lastly offering hypotheses on the method and suggestions for further research.},

  abstract = {Mangroves are a globally important ecosystem that provides a wide range of ecosystem system services, such as carbon capture and storage, coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Mangroves have significantly reduced in global extent over the last 50 years, primarily as a result of deforestation caused by the expansion of agriculture and aquaculture in coastal environments. However, a limited number of studies have attempted to estimate changes in global mangrove extent, particularly into the 1990s, despite much of the loss in mangrove extent occurring pre-2000. This study has used L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) global mosaic datasets from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for 11 epochs from 1996 to 2020 to develop a long-term time-series of global mangrove extent and change. The study used a map-to-image approach to change detection where the baseline map (GMW v2.5) was updated using thresholding and a contextual mangrove change mask. This approach was applied between all image-date pairs producing 10 maps for each epoch, which were summarised to produce the global mangrove time-series. The resulting mangrove extent maps had an estimated accuracy of 87.4\% (95th conf. int.: 86.2\textendash 88.6\%), although the accuracies of the individual gain and loss change classes were lower at 58.1\% (52.4\textendash 63.9\%) and 60.6\% (56.1\textendash 64.8\%), respectively. Sources of error included misregistration in the SAR mosaic datasets, which could only be partially corrected for, but also confusion in fragmented areas of mangroves, such as around aquaculture ponds. Overall, 152,604 km2 (133,996\textendash 176,910) of mangroves were identified for 1996, with this decreasing by -5245 km2 (-13,587\textendash 1444) resulting in a total extent of 147,359 km2 (127,925\textendash 168,895) in 2020, and representing an estimated loss of 3.4\% over the 24-year time period. The Global Mangrove Watch Version 3.0 represents the most comprehensive record of global mangrove change achieved to date and is expected to support a wide range of activities, including the ongoing monitoring of the global coastal environment, defining and assessments of progress toward conservation targets, protected area planning and risk assessments of mangrove ecosystems worldwide.},

The overall accuracy for mangrove extent was 94.0\% with a 99\% likelihood that the true value is between 93.6\&ndash;94.5\%, using 53,878 accuracy points across 20 sites distributed globally. Using the geographic regions of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Asia has the highest proportion of mangroves with 38.7\% of the global total, while Latin America and the Caribbean have 20.3\%, Africa has 20.0\%, Oceania has 11.9\%, North America has 8.4\% and the European Overseas Territories have 0.7\%. The methodology developed is primarily based on the classification of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data, where a habitat mask was first generated, within which the classification of mangrove was undertaken using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier. This new globally consistent baseline will also form the basis of a mangrove monitoring system using JAXA JERS-1 SAR, ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar data to assess mangrove change from 1996 to the present. However, when using the product, users should note that a minimum mapping unit of 1 ha is recommended and that the error increases in regions of disturbance and where narrow strips or smaller fragmented areas of mangroves are present. Artefacts due to cloud cover and the Landsat-7 SLC-off error are also present in some areas, particularly regions of West Africa due to the lack of Landsat-5 data and persistence cloud cover. In the future, consideration will be given to the production of a new global baseline based on 10 m Sentinel-2 composites.},

Although control measures including killing of dogs and use of insecticides have been applied at this locality, the canine seroprevalence remains at 25\% and during 1995 and 1997 eight autochthonous human cases were notified. In order to evaluate factors related to the increase of the risk for Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi infection in dogs we have screened 365 dogs by anti-Leishmania immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and captured sandflies in the domestic and peridomestic environment. Some variables related to the infection were assessed by uni- and multivariate analysis. The distance of the residence from the forest border, its altitude and the presence of the opossum Didelphis marsupialis in the backyard, were found predictor factors for L. (L.) chagasi infection in dogs in Barra de Guaratiba. The presence of Lutzomyia longipalpis in the peridomestic environment indicates the possibility of appearence of new human cases. Our data also suggest the presence of a sylvatic enzootic cycle at this locality.},

Innovative urban planning methods are in particular needed to benefit from energy efficient measures beyond the building scale. The aim of this paper is thus to explore the challenge of energy planning in cities, with the goal of providing a framework to better understand the problems and identify perspectives to tackle them. First, the evolution of urban planning is briefly described, with a focus on its progressive widening to include energetic issues. Then, European guidelines and perspectives on the subject are highlighted based on key policy documents. Finally, a systematic framework is proposed to describe the various and complex aspects of energy planning in cities. A few practical examples from two cities are presented to illustrate possible actions in line with the problem definition and European recommendations.},

  abstract = {Urban energy system planning (UESP) is a topic of growing concern for cities in deregulated energy markets, which plan to decrease energy demand, reduce their dependency on fossil fuels, and increase the share of renewable energy sources. UESP being a highly multisectoral and multi-actor task, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are frequently used in the decision processes. These methods may provide support in organizing and identifying solutions to problems with conflicting objectives. However, knowing which method to use is generally not straightforward, as the appropriateness of a method or combination of methods depends on the decision problem's context. Therefore, this article reviewed scientific papers to characterize and analyze MCDA problems and methods in the context of UESP. The review systematically explores issues such as the scope of the problems, the alternatives and criteria considered, the expected decision outcomes, the decision analysis methods and the rationales for selecting and combining them, and the role of values in driving the decision problems. The final outcome is a synthesis of the data and insights obtained, which may help potential users identify appropriate decision analysis methods based on given problem characteristics.},

This paper aims to make clear the many interrelated challenges and obstacles which hinder efficient urban energy planning. After reviewing the new requirements and goals of urban planning and its links with energy issues, a systematic framework to analyze the issues at stake is presented. The importance of such a structured and comprehensive definition and understanding of the problem is discussed, arguing that it is a necessary step to improve and develop adapted solutions which embrace the entirety of the problem.

Instead, planners work within the tension generated among these three fundamental aims, which, collectively, I call the ``planner's triangle,'' with sustainable development located at its center. This center cannot be reached directly, but only approximately and indirectly, through a sustained period of confronting and resolving the triangle's conflicts. To do so, planners have to redefine sustainability, since its current formulation romanticizes our sustainable past and is too vaguely holistic. Planners would benefit both from integrating social theory with environmental thinking and from combining their substantive skills with techniques for community conflict resolution, to confront economic and environmental injustice.},

  abstract = {In Brazil, the National System of Conservation Units addresses the commitments arising from the country's signature and ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This study evaluates the effectiveness of two protected areas (Conservation Units) in Brazil through the analysis of mangrove forest structure data. Structural and functional characteristics of mangrove forests are primarily governed by the interaction of environmental characteristics that act in global, regional and local scales. However, in areas submitted to strong influence of human activities disturbance should be considered seriously. Structural measurements were taken in 43 plots at the Guapimirim Environmental Protection Area and the Guanabara Ecological Station. The main structural characteristics of these forests are: mean diameter at breast height (DBH): from 3.6 to 12.3 cm; mean height: from 2.7 to 11.6 m; maximum height: from 6.5 to 16.7 m; live basal area: from 8.5 to 24.8 m{$^2$}.ha{$^{-1}$} and higher than 15 m{$^2$}.ha{$^{-1}$} at 26 plots; relative basal area of trunks with DBH higher than 10 cm: above 50\% at 28 plots and above 40\% at 37 plots. The forests studied presented higher structural development than the mangrove areas outside these protected areas reflecting a lower anthropogenic influence. On the other hand, when compared with other mangrove forests from the same segment of the Brazilian coast we noted that this development was not the optimum. The maintenance of these protected areas associated with better management strategies is very relevant to prevent the extinction of the remaining mangrove forests of the Guanabara Bay.},

  abstract = {Residential land planning, which is concerned with the physical development of land for residential use, is a multidisciplinary activity wherein the physical planner, engineer and architect play very prominent roles. Cost is paramount for low-income households. Therefore, in residential land planning for producing lots for this economic group, all possible efforts have to be made for reducing the cost per lot consistent with acceptable standards. To achieve this objective, residential land planning should be concerned not only with physical planning but should also take into account the interaction between the spatial design, the architectural design of the dwelling and the design and layout of utility systems so that the cost per lot including the service connection cost is minimised. In the paper, the systems nature of the residential land planning problem has been discussed and a cost-optimisation model for obtaining the optimum physical design of a planning module (a unit of design) fulfilling the given constraints has been developed using the technique of geometric programming. Application of the model is illustrated with a number of example problems using the field data, which show large cost differences from one system solution to another. This establishes the need for such an approach if cost reduction is the primary objective. The geometric programming technique of optimisation adopted in the paper could be used by a designer in the smallest design office with the help of a low-cost programmable calculator and the programmes developed by the author.},

  abstract = {Industrial ecology has emerged in recent years as a new multi-disciplinary field at the nexus of environmental science, engineering, business, and policy. Reflecting a systems view, industrial ecology sees industry embedded in the natural systems that surround it. This chapter offers explanations of industrial ecology concepts as well as practical examples and short case descriptions. It examines principles of industrial ecology; describes its core elements including design for environment, lifecycle analysis, material flow analysis, and industrial symbiosis; reviews policy approaches, discusses the relevance of industrial ecology in a developing world context, and discusses the parallel relationship of industrial ecology to the notion of the circular economy as it is developing in China.},

  abstract = {The comprehensiveness of environmental assessments of future long-distance travel that include high-speed rail (HSR) are constrained by several methodological, institutional, and knowledge gaps that must and can be addressed. These gaps preclude a robust understanding of the changes in environmental, human health, resource, and climate change impacts that result from the implementation of HSR in the United States. The gaps are also inimical to an understanding of how HSR can be positioned for 21st century sustainability goals. Through a synthesis of environmental studies, the gaps are grouped into five overarching grand challenges. They include a spatial incompatibility between HSR and other long-distance modes that is often ignored, an environmental review process that obviates modal alternatives, siloed interest in particular environmental impacts, a dearth of data on future vehicle and energy sources, and a poor understanding of secondary impacts, particularly in land use. Recommendations are developed for institutional investment in multimodal research, knowledge and method building around several topics. Ultimately, the environmental assessment of HSR should be integrated in assessments that seek to understand the complementary and competitive configurations of transportation services, as well as future accessibility.},

Recent innovations in wheelchair securement technology for LATVs may reduce these challenges. This field study builds on a recent lab study that used a full-scale LATV simulation apparatus to address similar knowledge gaps. The current study used a mixed-methods approach to explore the usability of two newer wheelchair securement systems currently installed in LATVs in Buffalo, NY: a 3-point, forward-facing (3P-FF) securement system and a semi-automated, rear-facing (SA-RF) securement system. Three groups of wheelchair users (manual wheelchair [MWC], power wheelchair [PWC], and scooter [SC] users; n\,=\,40) completed a pre-study interview, four trips on the LATVs and accompanying surveys, and a final interview. Using multiple usability rating scales, findings indicated clear differences in ratings of difficulty and acceptability between securement systems by wheelchair user group, with the SA-RF outperforming the 3P-FF on most usability measures for MWC and PWC users. SC users consistently rated both securement systems as more difficult to use and the SA-RF securement as less acceptable than MWC and PWC users.},

The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10\,m, 20\,m and 60\,m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30\,m MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30\,m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35\,million\,km2 and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015. The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCD09CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11\%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 L1T and Sentinel-2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90\% for the HLS product are 6.2\,m and 18.8\,m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring.},

A linear relationship was found when the biomass of each above-ground component was plotted against DBH on a log-log scale. The two Rhizophora species were found to have the greatest stem and total above-ground biomass for a given DBH, followed by B. parviflora, B. gymnorrhiza, C. tagal var. australis, and X. granatum, the last having a significantly lower biomass for a given DBH than the other five species.

Vertical diffusion of constitutional norms prevails over horizontal diffusion of norms, that is, states are more influenced by the federal constitution than they are by each other. In part, this top-down diffusion occurs through imitation, but it is also determined by coercion, reinforced by judicial decisions. Originality in Brazilian state constitutionalism owes more to the different ways of emulating the Federal Constitution than to the creation of its own norms, making state constitutionalism additional evidence of the centralism of this federation, at least in regard to the production of legal standards.

  abstract = {Maps are changing. They have become important and fashionable once more. Rethinking Maps brings together leading researchers to explore how maps are being rethought, made and used, and what these changes mean for working cartographers, applied mapping research, and cartographic scholarship. It offers a contemporary assessment of the diverse forms that mapping now takes and, drawing upon a number of theoretic perspectives and disciplines, provides an insightful commentary on new ontological and epistemological thinking with respect to cartography.  This book presents a diverse set of approaches to a wide range of map forms and activities in what is presently a rapidly changing field. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach to important contemporary mapping practices, with chapters written by leading theorists who have an international reputation for innovative thinking. Much of the new research around mapping is emerging as critical dialogue between practice and theory and this book has chapters focused on intersections with play, race and cinema. Other chapters discuss cartographic representation, sustainable mapping and visual geographies. It also considers how alternative models of map creation and use such as open-source mappings and map mash-up are being creatively explored by programmers, artists and activists. There is also an examination of the work of various `everyday mappers' in diverse social and cultural contexts.   This blend of conceptual chapters and theoretically directed case studies provides an excellent resource suited to a broad spectrum of researchers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in human geography, GIScience and cartography, visual anthropology, media studies, graphic design and computer graphics. Rethinking Maps is a necessary and significant text for all those studying or having an interest in cartography.},

Observations across diverse urban forms, sky view factors, and seasons covered a wide range of solar radiation regimes from a minimum TMRT of 8.7~\textdegree C to a maximum of 84.9~\textdegree C. Both models produced large simulation errors across regimes with RMSE ranging from 8~\textdegree C to 12~\textdegree C (RayMan) and 11.2~\textdegree C to 16.1~\textdegree C (ENVI-met), exceeding a suggested TMRT accuracy of {$\pm$}5~\textdegree C for heat stress studies. RayMan model errors were largest for engineered enclosed spaces, complex urban forms, and extreme heat conditions. ENVI-met was unable to resolve intra-domain spatial variability of TMRT and exhibited large errors with RMSE up to 25.5~\textdegree C for engineered shade. Both models failed to accurately simulate TMRT for hot conditions. Errors varied seasonally with overestimated TMRT in the summer and underestimated TMRT in the winter and shoulder seasons. Results demonstrate that models should not be used under micrometeorological or morphological extremes without in-situ validation to quantify errors and assess directional bias due to model limitations.},

  abstract = {In 2011, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) identified the need for improved methods of performing early conceptual trade studies and lifecycle analysis to design systems effective in a wide range of situations and adaptable to many others. This surge in interest within the DoD has been driven by a recognition that as systems grow in scale and complexity, and consequently cost, traditional methods of addressing design and operational uncertainties will no longer suffice. These challenges, which are not unique to the DoD, can be more broadly characterized as the need to achieve sustained value delivery from systems despite perturbations in design, context or stakeholder needs. Epoch Era Analysis (EEA) was developed to better model problems with lifecycle uncertainties and has demonstrated its usefulness in prior research studies, but it still faces significant challenges to practical application. Specifically, EEA can result in large, multivariate datasets that are difficult to generate, visualize and perform analysis on. When performing exploratory analysis on such model-generated data sets, human interaction is often necessary to identify important subsets of the data, resolve ambiguity or find inconsistencies. Although prior research towards methods for applying EEA constructs has been performed, a prescriptive framework that explicitly considers human interaction does not exist. To make informed decisions, and design successful strategies for value sustainment, effective visualization and analysis techniques are needed to derive valuable insights from this data. These challenges motivate this thesis research.},

However, the supply of sustainable energy is one of the main challenges that mankind will face over the coming decades.

The problem considers for the development of the MOEA, three different types of feedstock, one perennially grown grass, switchgrass, and two crop residues, corn stover and wheat straw.},

The results show that hurricanes have negative short-run effects on economic activity, with losses likely concentrated in coastal lowlands that are exposed to both wind and storm surge hazards. In these coastal lowlands, the estimates show that nightlights decrease by up to 24\% in areas that are unprotected by mangroves. By comparison, the impact of the hurricanes observed in the sample is fully mitigated in areas protected by mangrove belts of 1 km or more.},

Project teams can improve results by recognizing that the future is inevitably uncertain and that by creating flexible designs they can adapt to eventualities. This approach enables them to take advantage of new opportunities and avoid harmful losses. Designers of complex, long-lasting projects\textemdash such as communication networks, power plants, or hospitals\textemdash must learn to abandon fixed specifications and narrow forecasts. They need to avoid the ``flaw of averages,'' the conceptual pitfall that traps so many designs in underperformance. Failure to allow for changing circumstances risks leaving significant value untapped. This book is a guide for creating and implementing value-enhancing flexibility in design. It will be an essential resource for all participants in the development and operation of technological systems: designers, managers, financial analysts, investors, regulators, and academics.The book provides a high-level overview of why flexibility in design is needed to deliver significantly increased value. It describes in detail methods to identify, select, and implement useful flexibility. The book is unique in that it explicitly recognizes that future outcomes are uncertain. It thus presents forecasting, analysis, and evaluation tools especially suited to this reality. Appendixes provide expanded explanations of concepts and analytic tools.},

  abstract = {The ilities are properties of engineering systems that often manifest and determine value after a system is put into initial use (e.g. resilience, interoperability, flexibility). Rather than being primary functional requirements, these properties concern wider system impacts with respect to time and stakeholders. Over the past decade there has been increasing attention to ilities in industry, government and academia. Our research suggests that investigating ilities in sets may be more meaningful than study of single ilities in isolation. Some ilities are closely related and do in fact form semantic sets. Here, we use two methods to investigate over twenty ilities in terms of their prevalence and their interrelationships. We look for trends related to ilities of interest in relation to system type and an understanding of their collective use. First, we conducted a prevalence analysis of 22 ilities using both the internet as well as the Compendex/Inspec database as a source. We found over 1,275,000 scientific articles published between 1884 and 2010 and over 1.9 billion hits on the internet, exposing a clear prevalence-based ranking of ilities. Two questions we seek to address are: why and how are the ilities related to one another, and what can we do with this information. Initial steps to answer the first question include a 2-tupel-correlation matrix analysis that exposes the strongest relationships amongst ilities based on concurrent usage. Moreover, we conducted some preliminary experiments that indicate that a hierarchy of ilities with a few major groupings may be most useful. The overall objective for this research is to develop a formal framework and prescriptive guidance for effectively incorporating sets of ilities into the design of complex engineering systems.},

It has also exposed a deep crisis in modeling and exposed a lack of systems thinking by focusing mainly on only the short term and thinking of this event as only a health crisis. In this paper, authors from several of the key countries involved in COVID-19 propose a holistic systems model that views the problem from a perspective of human society including the natural environment, human population, health system, and economic system. We model the crisis theoretically as a feedback control problem with delay, and partial controllability and observability. Using a quantitative model of the human population allows us to test different assumptions such as detection threshold, delay to take action, fraction of the population infected, effectiveness and length of confinement strategies, and impact of earlier lifting of social distancing restrictions. Each conceptual scenario is subject to 1000+ Monte-Carlo simulations and yields both expected and surprising results. For example, we demonstrate through computational experiments that maintaining strict confinement policies for longer than 60 days may indeed be able to suppress lethality below 1\% and yield the best health outcomes, but cause economic damages due to lost work that could turn out to be counterproductive in the long term. We conclude by proposing a hierarchical Computerized, Command, Control, and Communications (C4) information system and enterprise architecture for COVID-19 with real-time measurements and control actions taken at leach level.},

  abstract = {The ilities are properties of engineering systems that often manifest and determine value after a system is put into initial use (e.g. resilience, interoperability, flexibility). Rather than being primary functional requirements, these properties concern wider system impacts with respect to time and stakeholders. Over the past decade there has been increasing attention to ilities in industry, government and academia. Our research suggests that investigating ilities in sets may be more meaningful than study of single ilities in isolation. Some ilities are closely related and do in fact form semantic sets. Here, we use two methods to investigate over twenty ilities in terms of their prevalence and their interrelationships. We look for trends related to ilities of interest in relation to system type and an understanding of their collective use. First, we conducted a prevalence analysis of 22 ilities using both the internet as well as the Compendex/Inspec database as a source. We found over 1,275,000 scientific articles published between 1884 and 2010 and over 1.9 billion hits on the internet, exposing a clear prevalence-based ranking of ilities. Two questions we seek to address are: why and how are the ilities related to one another, and what can we do with this information. Initial steps to answer the first question include a 2-tupel-correlation matrix analysis that exposes the strongest relationships amongst ilities based on concurrent usage. Moreover, we conducted some preliminary experiments that indicate that a hierarchy of ilities with a few major groupings may be most useful. The overall objective for this research is to develop a formalframework and prescriptive guidance for effectively incorporating sets of ilities intothe design of complex engineering systems.},

  abstract = {The problem with morality, according to Pragmatist John Dewey, is that it assumes an inherent lacking in human nature and then seeks, through constraining rules, punishment, and threat, to make humans act differently-act against their nature. This, he claims, is a battle doomed to fail. In Human Nature and Conduct, first published in 1922, Dewey brings the rigor of natural sciences to the quest for a better moral system. By studying habit, impulse, and intelligence, he arrives at a morality that is firmly rooted the context of the world, accounting for thinking humans with individual circumstances that do, indeed, make a difference when determining right and wrong. Students of sociology, philosophy, and psychology will be interested to see moral judgment investigated as a scientific question by one of America's most influential philosophers. American educator and philosopher JOHN DEWEY (1859-1952) helped found the American Association of University Professors. He served as professor of philosophy at Columbia University from 1904 to 1930 and authored numerous books, including The School and Society (1899), Experience and Nature (1925), Experience and Education (1938), and Freedom and Culture (1939).},

  abstract = {Rapid increase in urban population has created the need for the development of efficient Decision Support Systems (DSS) guiding municipal planners to mitigate urban sprawl, pollution and waste generation, unsustainable production and consumption patterns. To ensure sustainable urban planning, a DSS must provide not only an optimal planning solution based on input assumptions, but must also help to identify concrete city challenges, determine available resources (e.g., land and energy sources) and highlight any implementation constraints. It must support the creation of flexible interactive scenarios for urban development and their realistic representation in an urban context. This paper presents a Waste-to-Energy Decision Support System (WTEDSS) that identifies the optimal long-term deployment strategy for waste-to-energy infrastructures under future uncertain operational conditions and then directly assesses its feasibility and integration into an urban environment using 3D visualization. The WTEDSS is designed as an interactive and analytical waste management planning tool integrating four modules: data analytics, optimization, simulation and a user-friendly graphical interface. Emphasis is placed on the development and integration of the optimization module and 3D urban simulation, which provides users with decision support based on 3D visualized optimum facilities deployment plans. The optimization module receives calibrated data and solves a model based on inputs obtained from the user interface. The simulation platform developed in Unity 3D provides a friendly real-world environment for studying and understanding the facility deployment process over time and space, while also considering uncertainty.},

Model-based approaches to software development and systems engineering use technologies to include graphical modeling languages, such as the Systems Modeling Language, that support system design and analysis through machine readable models. This paper traces key historical contributions of software and systems engineers over the past five decades to show a coherent concept of models and how they can be used for software and systems engineering. Recent model-based systems engineering methodologies supported by commercially available modeling tools are also summarized. Relational orientation is seen to be the underlying viewpoint that expresses and binds these approaches. Relational orientation for systems engineering (ROSE) is then specified using a general systems methodology. Systems are seen to access each other's models in ROSE much like classes in object orientation access each other's objects. Object-oriented frames for software engineering are extended to relational frames to specify an innovative framework for system design and analysis. This generalizes the axiomatic design approach of N. P. Suh. A repeatable procedure supporting greater concurrency between design and verification is also demonstrated for searching the solution space in linear axiomatic design.},

Universality arises when the qualitative character of a system is sufficient to quantitatively predict its essential features, such as the exponents that characterize scaling laws. Within geomorphology, two areas where the concepts of scaling and universality have found application are the geometry of river networks and the statistical structure of topography. We begin this review with a pedagogical presentation of scaling and universality. We then describe recent progress made in applying these ideas to networks and topography. This overview leads to a synthesis that attempts a classification of surface and network properties based on generic mechanisms and geometric constraints. We also briefly review how scaling and universality have been applied to related problems in sedimentology\textemdash specifically, the origin of stromatolites and the relation of the statistical properties of submarine-canyon topography to the size distribution of turbidite deposits. Throughout the review, our intention is to elucidate not only the problems that can be solved using these concepts, but also those that cannot.},

System engineers refer to these life-cycle properties as the ``ilities.'' The ilities\textemdash repeatability, predictability, auditability, quality, reliability, flexibility, scalability, etc.\textemdash are nonfunctional requirements and properties that are usually used to evaluate the performance of the system, often after the system is in use.

Sociotechnical enterprises represent a microsociological construct. The ologies emerge from the interaction of people in the systems and have profound implications for systems engineers and managers analyzing, designing, maintaining, and transforming such systems. Therefore, systems engineers must have an understanding of the disciplines from the social sciences, such as sociology and philosophy. This article serves as an introduction to the prevalence and importance of the social sciences to the discipline of systems engineering, offers one proposed framework for understanding the connected nature of the ologies, and provides systems-relevant background and context provided by these sciences.},

However, such interventions come with immense social and economic costs and the relative effectiveness of different mobility restrictions are not well understood. Some recent works have used telecoms data sources that cover fractions of a population to understand behavioral changes and how these changes have impacted case growth. This study analyzed uniquely comprehensive datasets in order to examine the relationship between mobility and transmission of COVID-19 in the country of Andorra. The data consisted of spatio-temporal telecoms data for all mobile subscribers in the country, serology screening results for 91\% of the population, and COVID-19 case reports. A comprehensive set of mobility metrics was developed using the telecoms data to indicate entrances to the country, contact with tourists, stay-at-home rates, trip-making and levels of crowding. Mobility metrics were compared to infection rates across communities and transmission rate over time. All metrics dropped sharply at the start of the country's lockdown and gradually rose again as the restrictions were gradually lifted. Several of these metrics were highly correlated with lagged transmission rate. There was a stronger correlation for measures of indoor crowding and inter-community trip-making, and a weaker correlation for total trips (including intra-community trips) and stay-at-homes rates. These findings provide support for policies which aim to discourage gathering indoors while lifting the most restrictive mobility limitations.},

When organizations apply old methods of problem-solving to new kinds of problems, they may accomplish only temporary fixes or some ineffectual tinkering around the edges. Today's problems are a new breed\rule{1em}{1pt}open, complex, dynamic, and networked\rule{1em}{1pt}and require a radically different response. In this book, Kees Dorst describes a new, innovation-centered approach to problem-solving in organizations: frame creation. It applies ``design thinking,'' but it goes beyond the borrowed tricks and techniques that usually characterize that term. Frame creation focuses not on the generation of solutions but on the ability to create new approaches to the problem situation itself.The strategies Dorst presents are drawn from the unique, sophisticated, multilayered practices of top designers, and from insights that have emerged from fifty years of design research. Dorst describes the nine steps of the frame creation process and illustrates their application to real-world problems with a series of varied case studies. He maps innovative solutions that include rethinking a store layout so retail spaces encourage purchasing rather than stealing, applying the frame of a music festival to understand late-night problems of crime and congestion in a club district, and creative ways to attract young employees to a temporary staffing agency. Dorst provides tools and methods for implementing frame creation, offering not so much a how-to manual as a do-it-yourself handbook\rule{1em}{1pt}a guide that will help practitioners develop their own approaches to problem-solving and creating innovation.},

  abstract = {A "bracingly iconoclastic" (New York Times) critique of global development that points a way toward respect for the poor and an end to global povertyOver the last century, global poverty has largely been viewed as a technical problem that requires the right "expert" solution. Yet all too often, experts fix immediate problems without addressing the systematic oppression that created them. In The Tyranny of Experts, renowned economist William Easterly argues that the expert-approved, authoritarian approach to development has not only made little lasting progress, but has proven a convenient rationale for generations of human rights violations. Although aid agencies, such as the World Bank and the Gates Foundation, are still regarded as both well-meaning and effective, they're founded on the mistaken belief that wise technocrats from the West will be the saviors of helpless victims from the rest.This revised edition comes at a time of even greater peril for freedom worldwide. Easterly brings in new research that carries his masterful critiques into the present. He reveals the fundamental errors inherent in the long-celebrated top-down approach and offers a new model for developing countries-a model predicated on respect for the rights of poor people-with the power to end global poverty.},

The White Mans Burden is his widely anticipated counterpuncha brilliant and blistering indictment of the Wests economic policies for the worlds poor.

The earliest development management systems allocated land for development. An area of urbanization or an urban service area was established, bounded by an urban limit line. Lexington, Kentucky and Twin Cities, Minneapolis, two of the case studies discussed, are examples of the land allocation approach. This approach is frequently the choice of counties or metropolitan agencies lacking direct land use or capital programming control. It was logical that the next step in management, the support systems or budget approach, would center on the capital improvement program, addressing timing directly. The squeeze on public budgets was an additional factor in this choice. The case study on Ramapo, New York, discusses this type of approach. Another development management system aims to control the amount or rate of growth by housing unit allocation. Petaluma, California, another case study, addressed both growth and decline areas by employing this numerical type of allocation together with land allocation. A final type of management system, the activity allocation approach, is one that allocates activity, land and support services. San Diego, California is the last case study described in detail.},

Integration would be accomplished through purchase of service agreements between each agency and a local private transportation operator. A purchase of service agreement based on payment per passenger is also proposed. The vehicles (10 to 12 passenger vans) for the service are to come from a combination of public and private sources. To improve the management of the system, it is proposed that an automated computer-aided scheduling/financial control system be designed and implemented. To facilitate the implementation and monitoring of the service, some degree of coordination between participating agencies is required.

  abstract = {Modeling is essential to characterize and explore complex societal and environmental issues in systematic and collaborative ways. Socio-environmental systems (SES) modeling integrates knowledge and perspectives into conceptual and computational tools that explicitly recognize how human decisions affect the environment. Depending on the modeling purpose, many SES modelers also realize that involvement of stakeholders and experts is fundamental to support social learning and decision-making processes for achieving improved environmental and social outcomes. The contribution of this paper lies in identifying and formulating grand challenges that need to be overcome to accelerate the development and adaptation of SES modeling. Eight challenges are delineated: bridging epistemologies across disciplines; multi-dimensional uncertainty assessment and management; scales and scaling issues; combining qualitative and quantitative methods and data; furthering the adoption and impacts of SES modeling on policy; capturing structural changes; representing human dimensions in SES; and leveraging new data types and sources. These challenges limit our ability to effectively use SES modeling to provide the knowledge and information essential for supporting decision making. Whereas some of these challenges are not unique to SES modeling and may be pervasive in other scientific fields, they still act as barriers as well as research opportunities for the SES modeling community. For each challenge, we outline basic steps that can be taken to surmount the underpinning barriers. Thus, the paper identifies priority research areas in SES modeling, chiefly related to progressing modeling products, processes and practices.},

The OSSEs mimic the procedures used to analyze global observations for specifying states of the atmosphere. As simulations, however, OSSEs are not only confined to already existing observations and they provide a perfect description of the true state being analyzed. These two properties of the simulations can be exploited to improve both existing and envisioned observing systems and the algorithms to analyze them. Preliminary to any applications, however, the OSSE framework must be adequately validated. This first version of the simulated observations is drawn from a 13 month simulation of nature produced by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. These observations include simulated errors of both instruments and representativeness. Since the statistics of analysis and forecast errors are partially determined by these observational errors, their appropriate modelling can be crucial for validating the realism of the OSSE. That validation is performed by comparing the statistics of the results of assimilating these simulated observations for one summer month compared with the corresponding statistics obtained from assimilating real observations during the same time of year. The assimilation system is the three-dimensional variational analysis (GSI) scheme used at both the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and GMAO. Here, only statistics concerning observation innovations or analysis increments within the troposphere are considered for the validation. In terms of the examined statistics, the OSSE is validated remarkably well, even with some simplifications currently employed. In order to obtain this degree of success, it was necessary to employ horizontally correlated observation errors for both atmospheric motion vectors and some satellite observed radiances. The simulated observations with added observation errors appear suitable for some initial OSSE applications.},

However, the statistical evidence of these patterns remains poorly studied. In this study, these patterns are tested for the mangrove forests of Guaratiba (Southeast-Brazil). Seventy plots, classified according to physiographic type (fringe-21; basin-31; and transition-18), were analyzed. Applying the Kruskal\textendash Wallis ANOVA test (p{$<$}0.005), the plots were evaluated for structural development (density, mean D130, mean height and basal area), architecture (trunks/tree ratio) and species composition (\% basal area). The dependence of density on mean D130 was also tested for each physiographic type through regression analysis. The comparison of physiographic types in relation to species composition revealed that fringe forests are dominated by Avicennia schaueriana and basin and transition forests are similarly dominated by Rhizophora mangle and A. schaueriana. The occurrence of Laguncularia racemosa is significantly lower and concentrated in areas with greater freshwater input. The analysis of structural development confirmed the expected trend of increased size (diameter, height and basal area) and reduced density along the transition-basin-fringe gradient. We also observed a reduction in density variability along the same gradient. This reduction can be explained by increased environmental stability and reveals the existence of structural variability within physiographic types. Regression analysis showed, as expected, an inverse relationship between density and mean D130, which reflects the effect of competition on the structure of the fringe (R2=0.90, p{$<$}0.001) and basin forests (R2=0.83, p{$<$}0.001), but not for the transition stands (R2=0.02, p=0.63). Fringe and basin forests has similar regression coefficients (t=0.162, p{$>$}0.001) but fringe forests have higher structural development, what can be considered as evidence that they are in a more advanced successional stage than basin forests. In contrast, the absence of a relationship between density and mean D130 in the transition forests may be an indication that the transition forests are in a colonization phase, where the effect of competition does not yet regulate trunk density.},

Like the county poorhouse and scientific charity before them, digital tracking and automated decision-making hide poverty from the middle-class public and give the nation the ethical distance it needs to make inhumane choices: which families get food and which starve, who has housing and who remains homeless, and which families are broken up by the state. In the process, they weaken democracy and betray our most cherished national values.This deeply researched and passionate book could not be more timely.},

These three ecosystems produce services to a value estimated at 250 million \texteuro{} (M\texteuro )/year (valuation recently undertaken under the French initiative for Coral Reef Conservation\textemdash the IFRECOR program). It is estimated that around 60\% of this value originates from direct uses such as recreational activities (diving, excursions, beach activities, etc.) tourism and fisheries. Ecosystem services (indirect uses) such as coastal protection, carbon sequestration, biomass production and water purification are significant since their total value reaches 94M\texteuro{} annually (38\% of the total economic value). Non-use values linked to improvements in health of coastal ecosystems is estimated to be 10M\texteuro/year. At the ecosystem level, sea grass and mangrove contribute the most (per km2) to wealth creation (2.16M \texteuro/km2, 1.87M \texteuro/km2 respectively, against 1.78M \texteuro/km2 for coral reefs). They need, therefore, to benefit from protection and management measures in the same magnitude as coral reefs already receive. The valuation also shows that, due to policy inaction, the loss of value is about 2.5M \texteuro/year, which urges politicians to develop a sound conservation policy.},

  abstract = {Promoting urban transition is critical, particularly for China's rapid urbanization. Circular economy strategy is widely recognized as an effective way to achieve a low-carbon transition of cities through improved waste recycling and industrial symbiosis. However, the evidence of low-carbon benefit is less reported. While the carbon footprint (CFP) represents a mature tool responding to climate change concerns, limited studies have made use of CFP as a proxy for the performance of urban circular economy promotion. The aim of this paper is to investigate the CFP with a ten years span (2002\textendash 2012) of Guiyang, so as to understand how its circular economy practices have led to low-carbon benefits. Guiyang, one of China's national pilots of the Circular Economy (CE) City, the Low-Carbon City, as well as the Ecological Civilization City, has offered an ideal laboratory where the opportunities and challenges for a low-carbon urban transition can be explicitly discussed. A hybrid model that integrates an input-output (IO) approach and process-based inventory analysis is developed to distinguish between direct carbon emissions of sectors from energy consumption, and indirect carbon emissions related to upstream and downstream flows both from production and consumption perspectives. The CFP of Guiyang in 2002, 2007 (after becoming the circular economy pilot) and 2012 (with implementation of urban industrial symbiosis) are analyzed by taking the 2002 as year of business as usual (BAU) scenario. Particularly, we identify scenarios related to proposed urban industrial symbiosis. Results imply that dramatic resource saving and CFP reductions could be achieved simultaneously. Changes to the CFP in 2002, 2007 and 2012 provide critical insights into the role of circular economy in speeding up urban transition towards a low-carbon society. Finally, policy recommendations to tackle the barriers to regional low-carbon transition are proposed. We believe that this study is informative for policy makers of urban planning by shedding a light on innovative eco-industrial development and urban transition in China.},

  abstract = {Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forested wetlands with the highest carbon (C) density of all terrestrial ecosystems. Because of their exceptionally large C stocks and importance as a coastal buffer, their protection and restoration has been proposed as an effective mitigation strategy for climate change. The inclusion of mangroves in mitigation strategies requires the quantification of C stocks (both above and belowground) and changes to accurately calculate emissions and sequestration. A growing number of countries are becoming interested in using mitigation initiatives, such as REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), in these unique coastal forests. However, it is not yet clear how methods to measure C traditionally used for other ecosystems can be modified to estimate biomass in mangroves with the precision and accuracy needed for these initiatives. Airborne Lidar (ALS) data has often been proposed as the most accurate way for larger scale assessments but the application of ALS for coastal wetlands is scarce, primarily due to a lack of contemporaneous ALS and field measurements. Here, we evaluated the variability in field and Lidar-based estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) through the combination of different local and regional allometric models and standardized height metrics that are comparable across spatial resolutions and sensor types, the end result being a simplified approach for accurately estimating mangrove AGB at large scales and determining the uncertainty by combining multiple allometric models. We then quantified wall-to-wall AGB stocks of a tall mangrove forest in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique. Our results indicate that the Lidar H100 height metric correlates well with AGB estimates, with R 2 between 0.80 and 0.88 and RMSE of 33\% or less. When comparing Lidar H100 AGB derived from three allometric models, mean AGB values range from 192 Mg ha-1 up to 252 Mg ha-1. We suggest the best model to predict AGB was based on the East Africa specific allometry and a power-based regression that used Lidar H100 as the height input with an R 2 of 0.85 and an RMSE of 122 Mg ha-1 or 33\%. The total AGB of the Lidar inventoried mangrove area (6654 ha) was 1 350 902 Mg with a mean AGB of 203 Mg ha-1 {$\pm$}166 Mg ha-1. Because the allometry suggested here was developed using standardized height metrics, it is recommended that the models can generate AGB estimates using other remote sensing instruments that are more readily accessible over other mangrove ecosystems on a large scale, and as part of future carbon monitoring efforts in mangroves.},

According to the estimation results of the proposed integrated model, some urban and transport development policies are evaluated from the perspective of realizing an environmentally sustainable city.

Uma vez que, o indiv\'iduo n\~ao \'e distinto de seu lugar (RELPH, 1976) e cada pessoa possui uma geografia particular e pessoal (LOWENTHAL, 1982; COSGROVE, 2004), faz-se necess\'ario uma abordagem fenomenol\'ogica que privilegie o indiv\'iduo em seu lugar. Assim sendo, a disserta\c{c}\~ao tem por objetivo abordar o fen\^omeno gerado pelo referido processo de urbaniza\c{c}\~ao em Ilha de Guaratiba em suas diversas nuances, partindo do enfoque dos principais agentes desse processo: os guaratibanos.

Besides this important fact for our spatial analysis, wherewith qualitative research, we intend to focus another phenomena, with existential matter, because it is related to the guaratibas natives sentimental transformation. With this process, they had their pace of life touched. Once the human bean has no distinction of the place he lives(RELPH, 1976), and each person has a particular and personal geography (LOWENTHAL, 1982; COSGROVE, 2004), it is necessary to show the phenomena in such a way to put a focus in the inhabitant in its place. Actually, the dissertation has as an objective to discuss the phenomena created by the urbanizing process at Ilha de Guaratiba trough all of its aspects, beginning with the focus at the most important actors of this process: The guaratibas people.

Despite this overall interest, however, little attention has been devoted to adopting advanced technology-based e-learning approaches in developing specific platforms to support students experiencing learning disorders (LDs) difficulties. Among all, cognitive technologies could be integrated into advanced training platforms to empower students' abilities, especially in case of LDs. Indeed, several studies focus on LDs, especially analyzing: correlations among them, theories about their intern relationships and certain biological models on their basis. Also, computer-aided supports have been studied as a booster in learning process, to compensate individuals' difficulties. Despite this, few studies focus on the use of cognitive technology to trace a possible integration of these latter with pedagogical approaches to enhance learning processes. The present article focuses on experimenting a prototype of a web-based e-learning environment, preliminarily focused on helping students with dyslexia, considering some results obtained with priming and BCI from our previous researches. The preliminary results are reliable enough to allow future developments, studying deeper the potentiality of learning empowerment through cognitive technologies integrated into e-learning environments.},

  abstract = {New ways are becoming available for analyzing our social systems. These permit the design of revised policies to improve the behavior of the systems within which we live. Industrial dynamics relates system structure to behavior. Industrial dynamics belongs to the same general subject area as feedback systems, servomechanisms theory, and cybernetics. Industrial dynamics is the study of how the feedback loop structure of a system produces the dynamic behavior of that system. In managerial terms industrial dynamics makes possible the structuring of the components and policies of a system to show how the resulting dynamic behavior is produced. In terms of social systems it deals with the forces that arise within a system to cause changes through time. The structure of an urban area has been organized into a system model to show the life cycle dynamics of urban growth and decay. The results suggest that most of today's popular urban policies lie between neutral and detrimental in their effectiveness. Quite different policies are suggested when one comes to an understanding of why urban areas evolve as they do. The city shows the general characteristics of a complex system.},

  abstract = {To meet energy-reduction goals, cities are challenged with assessing building energy performance and prioritizing efficiency upgrades across existing buildings. Although current top-down building energy benchmarking approaches are useful for identifying overall efficient and poor performers across a portfolio of buildings at a city scale, they are limited in their ability to provide actionable insights regarding efficiency opportunities. Concurrently, advances in smart metering data analytics combined with new data streams available via smart metering infrastructure present the opportunity to incorporate previously undetectable temporal fluctuations into top-down building benchmarking analyses. This paper leveraged smart meter electricity data to develop daily building energy benchmarks segmented by strategic periods to quantify their variation from conventional, annual energy benchmarking strategies and investigate how such metrics can lead to near real-time energy management. The periods considered include occupied periods during the school year, unoccupied periods during the school year, occupied periods during the summer, unoccupied periods during the summer, and peak summer demand periods. Results showed that temporally segmented building energy benchmarks are distinct from a building's overall benchmark. This demonstrates that a building's overall benchmark masks periods in which a building is over- or underperforming during the day, week, or month; thus, temporally segmented energy benchmarks can provide a more specific and accurate measure for building efficiency. We discussed how these findings establish the foundation for digital twin\textendash enabled urban energy management platforms by enabling identification of building retrofit strategies and near-real-time efficiency in the context of the performance of an entire building portfolio. Temporally segmented energy benchmarking measures generated from smart meter data streams are a critical step for integrating smart meter analytics with building energy benchmarking techniques, and for conducting smarter energy management across a large geographic scale of buildings.},

This study quantified the ecosystem services and disservices of mangroves as written by colonial explorers from 1823\textendash 1883 through a literature survey of 96 expedition reports and studies. Ecosystem disservices were most commonly discussed (60\%), with settlers considering mangroves as reservoirs of diseases such as malaria, with wide-ranging implications, such as the global drainage of wetlands in the 19th\textendash 20th centuries. Multiple ecosystem services were discussed, especially provisioning services for export, representing colonial views of new lands as ripe for economic use. Interestingly, regulating services of mangroves such as erosion control and sediment accretion that are a focus of much contemporary research were recognized as early as 1865. This study shows that the ecosystem service paradigm has a long history in mangroves. We should not underestimate mangrove ecosystem disservices, and how contemporary perceptions of mangroves may be influenced by such historical viewpoints. Archival materials provide a rich resource to study human-environment interactions, and how they change through time.},

  abstract = {The mobile mud banks, several kilometres wide and about 30 km long, which form the sedimentary environment of the coast of the Guianas are a consequence of the huge particulate discharge of the Amazon. These mud banks shift towards the northwest, influenced by the combined action of accretion and erosion, a process also affected by periodic variability. Because of this movement, the coastline is unstable and continuously changing. Such changes determine the structure and composition of mangrove forests, the only type of vegetation adapted to this dynamic environment. The objectives of this study were to identify coastal changes that took place over the last 50 years, and to relate them to natural processes of turnover and replenishment of mangrove forests. These objectives have been achieved through a combination of remote sensing techniques (aerial photographs and SPOT satellite images) and field surveys in the area of the Sinnamary Estuary, French Guiana. Ground data were collected in representative mangrove forest stands, chosen as a function of their growth stages and their structural features, from pioneer and young stages to adult, mixed and declining formations. The coastline changes and the mangrove dynamics over the 1951\textendash 1999 period are analyzed through production of synthetic digital maps, showing an alternation of net accretion (1951\textendash 1966) and erosion periods (1966\textendash 1991), followed by the present accretion phase. Based on this structural, functional and historic information, a global scenario of mangrove forest dynamics is proposed, including a model of forest development, forest gap processes and sedimentological dynamics. The results of this research are discussed within the context of regional (coastal Amazonian area) and global climate.},

Land-based weather stations do not always adequately represent the weather occurring over a watershed, because they can be far from the watershed of interest and can have gaps in their data series, or recent data are not available. This study presents a method for using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) global meteorological dataset to obtain historical weather data and demonstrates the application to modelling five watersheds representing different hydroclimate regimes. CFSR data are available globally for each hour since 1979 at a 38-km resolution. Results show that utilizing the CFSR precipitation and temperature data to force a watershed model provides stream discharge simulations that are as good as or better than models forced using traditional weather gauging stations, especially when stations are more than 10 km from the watershed. These results further demonstrate that adding CFSR data to the suite of watershed modelling tools provides new opportunities for meeting the challenges of modelling un-gauged watersheds and advancing real-time hydrological modelling.

  abstract = {The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were heralded as opening a new chapter in international development, and have led to the use of global goals and target-setting as a central instrument defining the international development agenda. Despite this increased importance, little is understood about how they influence policy priorities of key stakeholders, and their broader consequences. While quantification is the key strength of global goals, it also involves simplification, reification and abstraction, which have far-reaching implications for redefining priorities. This paper highlights the key findings and conclusions of the Power of Numbers Project, which undertook 11 case studies of the effects of selected MDG goals/targets, including both the empirical effects on policy priorities and normative effects on development discourses, and drew specifically on human rights principles and human development priorities. While the Project found that the effects varied considerably from one goal/target to another, all led to unintended consequences in diverting attention from other important objectives and reshaping development thinking. Many of the indicators were poorly selected and contributed to distorting effects. The Project concludes that target-setting is a valuable but a limited and blunt tool, and that the methodology for target-setting should be refined to include policy responsiveness in addition to data availability criteria.},

Unexpectedly, the wastewater microbiome from RCH and P prior to week four was correlated with the samples collected from the HCF, suggesting a core bacterial community is expelled from the digest tract of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. The microbiota of wastewater sample positives for SARS-CoV-2 was strongly associated with enteric bacteria previously reported in patients with risk factors for COVID-19. We provide novel evidence that the wastewater microbiome associated with gastrointestinal manifestations appears to precede the SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage.

This paper ascertains the values of ecosystem services of 66 primary valuation studies with a total of 250 observations. The results indicate that the range of values is substantially wide. This range cannot be explained sufficiently by the various differences of the studies, as the explanatory power of the econometric estimations is low. Main influential factors on the values of ecosystem services are the elicitation methods, the types of ecosystem services considered, and the conservation status of the respective mangrove forest as Ramsar site. The results stress the significant economic values of ecosystem services of mangrove forests and the importance for conservation management. However, the results also caution against a direct transfer of benefits between sites. The substantial variety of site and country specifics warrants the implementation of separate, original valuation studies.},

This paper proposes a method of system analysis and partial simulation for urban structures for this purpose. It couples a discussion-based holistic approach for systems analysis  and modelling of urban structures with quantitative modelling and simulation of partial scenarios that serve to examine specific questions regarding the long-term development of urban structures. In the first part, the application in the City Lab Nuremberg West,  a multidisciplinary urban research laboratory, serves to develop the methodology and its illustration. The main objective is to examine the transition of the existing underperforming quarter to a sustainable and livable urban environment. Scenario-based experiments with respect to development paths determine robustness and risks of different configurations. The second part of the paper describes the transfer of the methodology to education.  The approach serves to teach students in the Energy-Efficient and Sustainable Building master course program an integrative way of planning a sustainable built environment.  The definition of educational objectives concerning the students' understanding and management of systemic interdependencies of sustainability help assess the use of the method in the classroom. The aim is to provide them with the competence to develop strategies for complex situations while planning a sustainable built environment.},

Nowadays, the results of data expansion are showing up in different fields. The users' contextual data are valuable in engineering and business domains, e.g., transportation, location-based services, and advertisement industry. Take mobile phones as an example. There are billions of subscriptions worldwide and sensor devices are digitizing people interactions. The data volume generated by mobile phones and the need to make better, fact-based, and real-time decisions, are the challenges facing researchers. Recently, new technologies based on cloud computing have emerged to process and analyze a large volume of data. We have utilized such technologies for the analysis of call detail records with the collaboration with a telecommunications company. We present an exploratory spatial data analysis algorithm and its analysis results. To prioritize different areas, detecting hotspots in a fast and accurate way is our objective. The findings of this research work can be helpful for urban planning and development as well as telecommunication infrastructure upgrading.},

  abstract = {Data volume grows explosively with the proliferation of powerful smartphones and innovative mobile applications. The ability to accurately and extensively monitor and analyze these data is necessary. Much concern in mobile data analysis is related to human beings and their behaviours. Due to the potential value that lies behind these massive data, there have been different proposed approaches for understanding corresponding patterns. To that end, monitoring people's interactions, whether counting them at fixed locations or tracking them by generating origin-destination matrices is crucial. The former can be used to determine the utilization of assets like roads and city attractions. The latter is valuable when planning transport infrastructure. Such insights allow a government to predict the adoption of new roads, new public transport routes, modification of existing infrastructure, and detection of congestion zones, resulting in more efficient designs and improvement. Smartphone data exploration can help research in various fields, e.g., urban planning, transportation, health care, and business marketing. It can also help organizations in decision making, policy implementation, monitoring and evaluation at all levels. This work aims to review the methods and techniques that have been implemented to discover knowledge from mobile phone data. We classify these existing methods and present a taxonomy of the related work by discussing their pros and cons.},

  abstract = {Aim Our scientific understanding of the extent and distribution of mangrove forests of the world is inadequate. The available global mangrove databases, compiled using disparate geospatial data sources and national statistics, need to be improved. Here, we mapped the status and distributions of global mangroves using recently available Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat archive. Methods We interpreted approximately 1000 Landsat scenes using hybrid supervised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. Each image was normalized for variation in solar angle and earth\textendash sun distance by converting the digital number values to the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance. Ground truth data and existing maps and databases were used to select training samples and also for iterative labelling. Results were validated using existing GIS data and the published literature to map `true mangroves'. Results The total area of mangroves in the year 2000 was 137,760 km2 in 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Approximately 75\% of world's mangroves are found in just 15 countries, and only 6.9\% are protected under the existing protected areas network (IUCN I-IV). Our study confirms earlier findings that the biogeographic distribution of mangroves is generally confined to the tropical and subtropical regions and the largest percentage of mangroves is found between 5\textdegree{} N and 5\textdegree{} S latitude. Main conclusions We report that the remaining area of mangrove forest in the world is less than previously thought. Our estimate is 12.3\% smaller than the most recent estimate by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. We present the most comprehensive, globally consistent and highest resolution (30 m) global mangrove database ever created. We developed and used better mapping techniques and data sources and mapped mangroves with better spatial and thematic details than previous studies.},

Perturbations/disruptions in CASoS bring with them the potential for far-reaching effects due to highly-saturated interdependencies and attendant vulnerabilities to cascades in associated systems. For example, the global effects of disruption within CASoS can be seen in the impacts of the Japanese earthquake/tsunami on not only the people and industry of Japan, but also on US car manufacturers, on global energy and financial markets, and on the future of nuclear power production around the world. We approach this sort of high-impact problem space as engineers, devising interventions or problem solutions that influence CASoS to achieve specific aspirations, an activity we call CASoS Engineering. Through application to real-world problems, the CASoS Engineering Initiative at Sandia National Laboratories is evolving CASoS Engineering principles while growing a community of practice and the CASoS engineers to populate it. The Initiative is both grounded in reality and works to extend our understanding and control of that reality; it is both a solution within a CASoS and a CASoS itself. We seek collaborators -engineers, problem holders, analysts, all those reaching for dynamic, adaptive solutions -to join in the evolution of the discipline of CASoS Engineering.},

  abstract = {Problem: Despite the widespread availability of geographic information systems (GIS) in local government, there is some evidence that the potential of GIS as a planning tool is not being fully exploited. While obstacles to GIS implementation in local government have been investigated, most of these investigations are either dated or do not focus on planning applications. Purpose: We aim to add to the limited literature on the current barriers hindering GIS use in public planning agencies. We also offer some insights into how to mitigate these barriers and help planning agencies move beyond using GIS simply for routine tasks of data access and mapmaking. Methods: We analyzed responses to a 2007 web-based survey of 265 practitioners in Wisconsin's public planning agencies and follow-up interviews with 20 practitioners we conducted in 2008. Results and conclusions: Planning departments still face a range of technological, organizational, and institutional barriers in using GIS. Training, funding, and data issues appear to be the most significant barriers preventing greater use of GIS for planning purposes, suggesting that organizational and institutional issues are more pertinent than technological barriers. Our literature review indicates that the barriers to GIS use in local government are similar to those of the past, but not identical. Furthermore, our observations indicate that, in general, practitioners are not aware of the full potential of GIS and planning support systems (PSS). Takeaway for practice: Increased funding alone is not likely to move a planning agency beyond routine applications of GIS. Improved access to training that is geared toward the planning process and planning applications may help alleviate many barriers planners face in using GIS in general and in incorporating more sophisticated GIS functions in their work. Research support: This work was supported in part by the Consortium for Rural Geospatial Innovations, funded by the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Services of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and in part by the University of Wisconsin\textendash Madison College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the University of Wisconsin\textendash Extension.},

  abstract = {Insurgents have effectively employed asymmetric tactics, such as suicide bombers, as viable threats in urban environments. These threats are hard to detect and have proven difficult to thwart or defeat. The political, cultural, and physical environments in which they are implemented are not as readily constrainable as they are in full combat operations. Moreover, our limited understanding of human behaviors that drive the insurgent's planning, actions, and reactions, and the insurgent's ability to capitalize on the nature of the urban environment in Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction (SSTR) Operations adds to the complexity and challenges of detecting and defeating this threat. There is a need to increase our understanding of the decision making processes of threats in the larger context of the physical and cultural environment so that we can provide a means to identify threats by evoking responses or producing recognizable patterns such that we begin to shift the advantage in this contemporary operational environment in our favor. Previous research explored the feasibility of using agent based modeling environments to study these issues. Our current research extends this work, applying agent based modeling and simulation, extensions of electromagnetic field theory, and experimental design techniques to study these issue. This paper will discuss insights into insurgent decisioning given different tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), particularly those associated with traffic flow/traffic control point (TCP) strategies, employed by counterinsurgents with the goal of shaping insurgent behaviors to make detecting them or defeating them more likely.},

  abstract = {Maps are changing. They have become important and fashionable once more. Rethinking Maps brings together leading researchers to explore how maps are being rethought, made and used, and what these changes mean for working cartographers, applied mapping research, and cartographic scholarship. It offers a contemporary assessment of the diverse forms that mapping now takes and, drawing upon a number of theoretic perspectives and disciplines, provides an insightful commentary on new ontological and epistemological thinking with respect to cartography.  This book presents a diverse set of approaches to a wide range of map forms and activities in what is presently a rapidly changing field. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach to important contemporary mapping practices, with chapters written by leading theorists who have an international reputation for innovative thinking. Much of the new research around mapping is emerging as critical dialogue between practice and theory and this book has chapters focused on intersections with play, race and cinema. Other chapters discuss cartographic representation, sustainable mapping and visual geographies. It also considers how alternative models of map creation and use such as open-source mappings and map mash-up are being creatively explored by programmers, artists and activists. There is also an examination of the work of various `everyday mappers' in diverse social and cultural contexts.   This blend of conceptual chapters and theoretically directed case studies provides an excellent resource suited to a broad spectrum of researchers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in human geography, GIScience and cartography, visual anthropology, media studies, graphic design and computer graphics. Rethinking Maps is a necessary and significant text for all those studying or having an interest in cartography.},

The local community was invited to gather in a physical space and a virtual space simultaneously, and a physical moderator and virtual designer orchestrated deliberation.This project demonstrates the design values central to augmented deliberation: (1) it is a multimedia group communication process which balances the specific affordances of digital technologies with the established qualities of face-to-face group deliberation; (2) it emphasizes the power of experience; and (3) it promotes sustainability and reproducibility through digital tracking. Augmented deliberation, when properly designed, provides a powerful mechanism to enable productive and meaningful public deliberation. The article concludes with directions for further research.},

In this paper, we review the SoS literature to illustrate the need to create an SoSE management framework based on the demands of constant technological progress in a complex dynamic environment. We conclude from this review that the history and evolution of defining SoS has shown that: (1) SoS can be defined by distinguishing characteristics and (2) SoS can be viewed as a network where the ldquobest practicesrdquo of network management can be applied to SoSE. We use these two theories as a foundation for our objective to create an effective SoSE management framework. To accomplish this, we utilize modified fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) network principles (SoSE management conceptual areas). Furthermore, cited distinguishing characteristics of SoS are also used to present a SoSE management framework. We conclude with a case analysis of this framework using a known and well-documented SoS (i.e., Integrated Deepwater System) to illustrate how to better understand, engineer, and manage within the domain of SoSE.},

The forced fragmentation of this ecosystem affects the genetic diversity distribution among natural populations. Moreover, while restoration efforts have increased, few studies have analyzed how recently-planted areas impact the original mangrove genetic diversity. We analyzed the genetic diversity of two mangroves species (Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia schaueriana) in three areas in Brazil, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Using the local approach, we identified the genetic diversity pool of a restored area compared to nearby areas, including the remnant plants inside the restored area, one well-conserved population at the shore of Guanabara Bay, and one impacted population in Ara\c{c}\'a Bay. The results for L. racemosa showed that the introduced population has lost genetic diversity by drift, but remnant plants with high genetic diversity or incoming propagules could help improve overall genetic diversity. Avicennia schaueriana showed similar genetic diversity, indicating an efficient gene flow. The principal component analysis showing different connections between both species indicate differences in gene flow and dispersal efficiencies, highlighting the needed for further studies. Our results emphasize that genetic diversity knowledge and monitoring associated with restoration actions can help avoid bottlenecks and other pitfalls, especially for the mangrove ecosystem.},

Design challenges include decentralized operation and management and socio-technical complexities not commonly addressed by modeling and simulation methods. This paper seeks to tackle these challenges by applying aspects of military wargaming to promote effective communication between decision-makers. A software architecture for federated simulation based on IEEE-1516 (HLA-Evolved) is presented in the context of multiple lunar in-situ resource production processes, resource depots, and intermediate transportation. The federation-level framework identifies interfaces between simulation models (federates), focusing on persistent assets (elements) and resources exchanged. Future work will develop the federated resource economy model and evaluate with decision-makers playing the roles of competing and collaborating players.},

This paper presents a simulation gaming approach to collaborative infrastructure system design leveraging the technical strengths of simulation models and the social strengths of multi-player engagement in a game execution. In a strategic engineering game, models representing each constituent infrastructure system share a common graph-theoretic modeling framework and are integrated using the HLA-Evolved standard for interoperable federated simulations. A prototype game instantiation based on a space-based resource economy supporting future space exploration is discussed with the objective of identifying how factors of game play influence insights to collaborative system design. Future work seeks to develop, execute, and evaluate the prototype game to further research the use of simulation games in supporting collaborative system design.},

  abstract = {A growing number of studies have focused on evaluating spectral indices in terms of their sensitivity to vegetation biophysical parameters, as well as to external factors affecting canopy reflectance. In this context, leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are valuable for modeling and understanding the behavior of such indices. In the present work, PROSPECT and SAILH models have been used to simulate a wide range of crop canopy reflectances in an attempt to study the sensitivity of a set of vegetation indices to green leaf area index (LAI), and to modify some of them in order to enhance their responsivity to LAI variations. The aim of the paper was to present a method for minimizing the effect of leaf chlorophyll content on the prediction of green LAI, and to develop new algorithms that adequately predict the LAI of crop canopies. Analyses based on both simulated and real hyperspectral data were carried out to compare performances of existing vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index [RDVI], Modified Simple Ratio [MSR], Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index [SAVI], Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index [SARVI], MSAVI, Triangular Vegetation Index [TVI], and Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index [MCARI]) and to design new ones (MTVI1, MCARI1, MTVI2, and MCARI2) that are both less sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and linearly related to green LAI. Thorough analyses showed that the above existing vegetation indices were either sensitive to chlorophyll concentration changes or affected by saturation at high LAI levels. Conversely, two of the spectral indices developed as a part of this study, a modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) and a modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI2), proved to be the best predictors of green LAI. Related predictive algorithms were tested on CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) hyperspectral images and, then, validated using ground truth measurements. The latter were collected simultaneously with image acquisition for different crop types (soybean, corn, and wheat), at different growth stages, and under various fertilization treatments. Prediction power analysis of proposed algorithms based on MCARI2 and MTVI2 resulted in agreements between modeled and ground measurement of non-destructive LAI, with coefficients of determination (r2) being 0.98 for soybean, 0.89 for corn, and 0.74 for wheat. The corresponding RMSE for LAI were estimated at 0.28, 0.46, and 0.85, respectively.},

  abstract = {Maps are changing. They have become important and fashionable once more. Rethinking Maps brings together leading researchers to explore how maps are being rethought, made and used, and what these changes mean for working cartographers, applied mapping research, and cartographic scholarship. It offers a contemporary assessment of the diverse forms that mapping now takes and, drawing upon a number of theoretic perspectives and disciplines, provides an insightful commentary on new ontological and epistemological thinking with respect to cartography.  This book presents a diverse set of approaches to a wide range of map forms and activities in what is presently a rapidly changing field. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach to important contemporary mapping practices, with chapters written by leading theorists who have an international reputation for innovative thinking. Much of the new research around mapping is emerging as critical dialogue between practice and theory and this book has chapters focused on intersections with play, race and cinema. Other chapters discuss cartographic representation, sustainable mapping and visual geographies. It also considers how alternative models of map creation and use such as open-source mappings and map mash-up are being creatively explored by programmers, artists and activists. There is also an examination of the work of various `everyday mappers' in diverse social and cultural contexts.   This blend of conceptual chapters and theoretically directed case studies provides an excellent resource suited to a broad spectrum of researchers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in human geography, GIScience and cartography, visual anthropology, media studies, graphic design and computer graphics. Rethinking Maps is a necessary and significant text for all those studying or having an interest in cartography.},

  abstract = {Personal mobility vehicles (PMVs) are gaining popularity as an eco-friendly transport mode for short-distance trips in urban environments. These vehicles can provide numerous economic, environmental, and social benefits and are likely to become more common in urban spaces in the near future. Before permitting them in shared environments, the impacts of the PMVs on the other users of the shared space should be properly evaluated, particularly from a safety perspective. This study focuses on pedestrians' danger perception toward PMVs interacting with them in shared spaces. To estimate the perceived danger, a model was developed. The developed model is inspired by the social-force concept, and it estimates a safety index called subjective danger index (SDI). The model is then calibrated with data collected through controlled laboratory experiments. The experiments revealed two important features of the pedestrians' subjective danger perception against PMVs. First, the pedestrians' sensitivity to the distance between a PMV and them is higher when the PMV is in front of them compared to when it is behind them. Secondly, pedestrians perceive a PMV in front of them as more dangerous compared to a PMV behind them when they are near the PMV, although they perceive higher danger when a PMV is approaching from behind them compared to when a PMV is approaching from the front of them when they are relatively far from the PMV. The calibration results demonstrate that the enhanced model can accurately capture such trends and therefore the perception of danger. A case study that uses experimental trajectory data from a PMV\textendash pedestrian interaction situation is also presented to clarify potential applications, characteristics, and limitations of the calibrated SDI model.},

This recognition brings with it the richness of many well-developed theories and methods from economics, operations research, decision sciences, and other disciplines. Done correctly, it forces the process of engineering design into a total systems context, and demands that design decisions account for a product's total life cycle. It also provides a theory of design that is based on a rigorous set of axioms that underlie value theory. But the rigor of decision-based design also places stringent conditions on the process of engineering design that eliminate popular approaches such as Quality Function Deployment. This paper presents the underlying notions of decision-based design, points to some of the axioms that underlie the theory of decision-based design, and discusses the consequences of the theory on engineering education.},

The most obviously "dynamic" of map symbols are the oriented, or directional, ones such as the concentric circles and arrows drawn on the German maps to indicate the pressures of Einkreisung constraint and the counterforces of a Durchbruch strategy. Not only Harrison's standard-projection maps but also his wonderful bird's-eye-view, or perspective, maps of the various theaters of Second World War demonstrated brilliantly the virtues of cartographic agility.},

  abstract = {Mangroves, seagrass meadows, and salt marshes, collectively termed ``Blue Forests,'' are counted among the most valuable and productive coastal ecosystems on the planet. A recent literature review of the Blue Forest valuation research identified mangroves as the most frequently analyzed of these ecosystems, yet the literature demonstrates several deficits in terms of geographic location of studies, methods used to value the services, and most notably, a lack of valuation for cultural services. To better understand this, we analyzed the studies dealing specifically with mangroves from the original literature review to quantify what has been valued, where, by which methods, and the variation in the published values. We then use this information to synthesize our current level of knowledge on the type and value of services provided by mangroves, discuss data gaps, and address specifically the collection of data relevant to cultural ecosystem services (CES). Our results shed light on two principle issues affecting the mangrove valuation literature: overuse of benefit transfer in valuing mangrove ecosystem services and a lack of attention paid to the CES that mangroves provide. The mangrove valuation literature is not yet robust, lacking estimates of many ecosystem services, including CES, such as spiritual and aesthetic value. Most published studies focus on a small selection of ecosystem services based on the availability of benefit transfer values and the ability to easily measure values with market prices. Thus, many ecosystem services that cannot be valued monetarily, but that are often equally important to local communities, are ignored. Given the wide range of ecosystem services mangroves provide and the variety of valuation methods that need to be collectively employed, we argue that doing valuation studies well requires a multi-disciplinary approach, bringing together anthropologists, social scientists, ecologists and economists. Thoughtfully and thoroughly including the local stakeholders in valuation studies and the resultant policy discussions leads to a more holistic understanding of the services mangroves provide, and viable solutions with an increase in local willingness to act in accordance with those solutions.},

Alisha Holland demonstrates that this forbearance towards activities such as squatting and street vending is a powerful strategy for attracting the electoral support of poor voters. In many developing countries, state social programs are small or poorly targeted and thus do not offer politicians an effective means to mobilize the poor. In contrast, forbearance constitutes an informal welfare policy around which Holland argues much of urban politics turns. While forbearance offers social support to those failed by their governments, it also perpetuates the same exclusionary welfare policies from which it grows.},

Existing policies and management situations were investigated and analyzed based on the reduction, reuse and recycle principles. Results reveal that primary barriers of reducing CDW in China include lack of building design standard for reducing CDW, low cost for CDW disposal and inappropriate urban planning. Barriers to reuse CDW include lack of guidance for effective CDW collection and sorting, lack of knowledge and standard for reused CDW, and an under-developed market for reused CDW. As for recycling of CDW, key challenges are identified as ineffective management system, immature recycling technology, under-developed market for recycled CDW products and immature recycling market operation. Proposals to improve the current situation based on 3R principle are also proposed, including designing effective circular economy model, reinforcing the source control of CDW, adopting innovative technologies and market models, and implementing targeted economic incentives.},

The Summit Plaza TE project is a demonstration effort of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) currently being administered by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) for analysis of the performance and overall viability of the Total Energy facility. Included in the scope of this study is the following: (1) Analysis of the installed energy system; (2) Conceptual design of alternate energy systems; (3) Estimates of the capital costs of the existing system and each alternate system; (4) Estimates of the operation and maintenance costs of the existing system and alternate systems; (5) Simulation of the energy systems operating through a typical year to determine energy demands and consumptions. The data in this report are incorporated into the Final Report being prepared by NBS for the HUD Total Energy Demonstration Project. The Final Report will compare the energy, economic, reliability, and environmental viability of each energy system.},

  abstract = {Mangrove forests are under global pressure. Habitat destruction and degradation persist despite longstanding recognition of the important ecological functions of mangroves. Hence new approaches are needed to help stakeholders and policy-makers achieve sound management that is informed by the best science. Here we explore how the new policy concept of Climate Compatible Development (CCD) can be applied to achieve better outcomes. We use economic valuation approaches to combine socio-economic data, projections of forest cover based on quantitative risk mapping and storyline scenario building exercises to articulate the economic consequences of plausible alternative future scenarios for the mangrove forests of the South Kenya coast, as a case study of relevance to many other areas. Using data from 645 household surveys, 10 focus groups and 74 interviews conducted across four mangrove sites, and combining these with information on fish catches taken at three landing sites, a mangrove carbon trading project and published data allowed us to make a thorough (although still partial) economic valuation of the forests. This gave a current value of the South Coast mangroves of USD 6.5 million, or USD 1166~ha-1, with 59\% of this value on average derived from regulating services. Quantitative risk mapping, projecting recent trends over the next twenty years, suggests a 43\% loss of forest cover over that time with 100\% loss at the most vulnerable sites. Much of the forest lost between 1992 and 2012 has not been replaced by high value alternative land uses hence restoration of these areas is feasible and may not involve large opportunity costs. We invited thirty eight stakeholders to develop plausible storyline scenarios reflecting Business as Usual (BAU) and CCD \textendash{} which emphasises sustainable forest conservation and management \textendash{} in twenty years time, drawing on local and regional expert knowledge of relevant policy, social trends and cultures. Combining these scenarios with the quantitative projections and economic baseline allowed the modelling of likely value added and costs avoided under the CCD scenario. This suggests a net present value of more than US\$20 million of adoption of CCD rather than BAU. This work adds to the economic evidence for mangrove conservation and helps to underline the importance of new real and emerging markets, such as for REDD~+ projects, in making this case for carbon-rich coastal habitats. It demonstrates a policy tool \textendash{} CCD \textendash{} that can be used to engage stakeholders and help to co-ordinate policy across different sectors towards mangrove conservation.},

  abstract = {The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported from Wuhan, China, on December 31st, 2019. As the number of coronavirus infections has exceeded 100,000 with toll deaths of about 5000 worldwide as of early March, 2020, scientists and researchers are racing to investigate the nature of this virus and evaluate the short and long term effects of this disease. Despite its negative impacts that obliged the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the rate of mortality of this infection has not exceeded 3.4\% globally. On the other hand, the mortality rate caused by ambient air pollution has contributed to 7.6\% of all deaths in 2016 worldwide. The outbreak of COVID-19 has forced China to lockdown its industrial activities and hence dropped its NO2 and carbon emissions by 30 and 25\%, respectively. This work reports on the first case study that compares the air quality status before and after the crisis. It sheds light on the facts related to the demographics of deaths by gender, age and health status before infection. The historical data on air quality, estimates of annual deaths and its economic burden have been presented and analyzed. The actual daily deaths due to COVID-19 have been obtained from the official records of the daily Situation Reports published by World Health Organization as of March 11th. The rate of mortality due to COVID-19 was impacted by two factors: age and health status. Results show that 75\% of deaths were related to cases that had underlying present diseases with the majority aged of 80+ years. The reported figures were compared with the average daily mortality due to poor air quality which reached up to 3287 deaths due to high levels of NO2, O3 and PM. The air quality status before the crisis was compared with the current situation showing that COVID-19 forced-industrial and anthropogenic activities lockdown may have saved more lives by preventing ambient air pollution than by preventing infection.},

  abstract = {The effects of preventing a COVID-19 health crisis have had unintended consequences on domestic abuse (DA) victimization. We contribute to the literature on domestic abuse in lockdown by providing insight on how changing patterns of domestic abuse can explain differences in magnitudes reported across studies. We examine the patterns of domestic abuse during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greater London and find that the lockdown changed the nature of reporting and the type of relationship the abuse occurs within. While abuse by current partners as well as family members increased on average by 8.1\% and 17.1\% respectively over the lockdown period, abuse by ex-partners declined by 11.4\%. These findings show that reporting the average change in domestic abuse during lockdown can be misleading when designing a policy response. Moreover, we show that all the increase in domestic abuse calls is driven by third party reporting, particularly evident in areas with high density. This suggests that under reporting is present in the lockdown, particularly in households where the abuse cannot be reported by an outsider. Although these findings pertain to the COVID-19 lockdown, they also highlight the role that victim exposure and proximity has in affecting domestic abuse.},

  abstract = {In today's society, it is very common for decisions that influence us all to be made by a combination of interested parties, all with their own agenda. In this instance, how can we be sure that the decision is the correct one, not just decided by the group with the most political influence or most money? Such groups have now become fundamental decision-making units within and between organisations in most societies and are more often than not very complex structures. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Groupware can be used in several practical contexts to make sure that spatial decision problems are overcome in the most effective way.A fundamental aspect of a spatial decision problem is the matter of location. The complexity of spatial decision problems result from the multiplicity of stakeholders involved, their often conflicting interests, and the intangible variables of the decision environment. Examples of such problems include: where to locate a public facility, which brownfield redevelopment strategy to choose, which sites to select for environmental restoration, or which comprehensive land use plan to adopt. Good solutions to such problems -if they exist at all- are characterised by a certain minimum level of secretarial support; hence the decision-making process should involve experts, citizens, and interest groups alike. Such a collaborative approach to spatial decision-making needs methodology, tools, and application examples to inspire its adoption and more widespread use. This book sets out the key to the collaborative spatial decision-making approach: its theoretical basis, the requisite tools, and a number of application examples.GIS professionals and researchers should find this an invaluable guide to an emerging area of GIS},

The decision-making process, involving policy priorities, trade-offs, and uncertainties, can be aided by Multiple Criteria Decision making (MCDM) methods. This paper presents a framework for integrating geographical information systems (GIS) and MCDM methods. In this framework the MCDM methods are classified and matched with choice heuristics used by the decision-makers in the presence of competing alternatives and multiple evaluation criteria. Two strategies for integrating GIS with MCDM are proposed. The first strategy suggests linking GIS and MCDM techniques using a file exchange mechanism. The second strategy suggests integrating GIS and MCDM functions using a common database. The paper presents the implementation of the first strategy using PC-ARC/INFO, a file exchange module, and four different MCDM computer programs.},

  abstract = {Mangroves are highly complex ecosystems occupying a major part of tropical coastlines. High primary productivity, efficient biological nutrient recyling and a permanent exchange with terrestrial and marine ecosystems are their common features. Despite the high production and export rates of leaf litter, mangrove detritus has been reported to be of minor importance in sustaining marine food webs. The geographical distribution of mangrove-derived organic matter (OM) in marine sediments is found to be restricted to the vicinity of its source. Dissolved nutrient inputs from mangroves and rivers may fuel the production of marine OM. In this paper we assess the relevance of mangroves for the production and sedimentation of OM in the tropical coastal ocean based on data available from the literature and our own research results. We estimate the rates of carbon accumulation in mangrove sediments and of carbon export to the coastal seas. From the rates of litter fall and export we calculate carbon accumulating in mangrove sediments to be in the order of 23\texttimes 1012~g C per year and mangrove carbon introduced into the coastal ocean to be in the order of 46\texttimes 1012~g C per year. They account for about 11\% of the total input of terrestrial carbon into the ocean and 15\% of the total carbon accumulating in modern marine sediments.},

Seven data input model derived from Landsat 5TM bands, ALOS PALSAR FBD, and spectral transformations (NDVI, NDWI, NDBI) were examined by both classifiers. Feature objects statistical parameters were selected and implemented on random forest classifier. Overall accuracy (OA) as well as user and producer accuracies and Kappa statistic were used to compare classification results. Our results showed that the more data model used produced higher overall accuracy and kappa statistics for RF classifier. For each data input model, random forest classifier has higher overall accuracy than maximum likelihood. The best mangrove discrimination in RF classifier was achieved when the combination of Landsat 5 TM, SAR, and spectral transformation were used, while in ML classifier, the best mangrove discrimination was achieved when the combination of Landsat 5 TM and ALOS PALSAR was used. The overall accuracy achieved by RF classifier was 81.1\% and 0.76 for Kappa statistic. Meanwhile, for ML classifier, the overall accuracy achieved was 77.7\% and 0.71 for Kappa statistic.},

Although soils are directly or indirectly responsible for diverse ecosystem services in mangrove ecosystems, few studies have focused on the recovery of soil functions (e.g., carbon sequestration) after mangrove replanting. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery of soil processes associated with Fe, S, and C dynamics and its implications for the restoration of soil functions. Two mangrove sites under replanting initiatives were studied along the Brazilian coast (i.e., NE and SE). The study was conducted in 3- and 7-year-old replanted mangrove forests, and a comparison was made with degraded and mature mangroves. Particle size, soil C stocks, Fe forms, total Fe and S contents, degrees of pyritization of Fe, and mineralogical assemblages were assessed. Seven years after replanting, soil C stocks increased by 42\% and 29\% in mangrove soils from the NE and SE sites, respectively. In addition, significant increases were observed in fine particles, reactive Fe, and pyrite contents in replanted plots. These new conditions promoted organic matter accumulation, stabilization, and potential metal retention. Our findings highlight the potential of revegetation programs for recovering soil processes and essential soil functions.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of urbanization during the past decades has significantly improved people's lives but also introduced new challenges on effective functional urban planning and transportation management. The functional regions defined based on a static boundary rarely reflect an individual's daily experience of the space in which they live and visit for a variety of purposes. Fortunately, the increasing availability of spatiotemporal data provides unprecedented opportunities for understanding the structure of an urban area in terms of people's activity pattern and how they form the latent regions over time. These ecological regions, where people temporarily share a similar moving behavior during a short period of time, could provide insights into urban planning and smart-city services. However, existing solutions are limited in their capacity of capturing the evolutionary patterns of dynamic latent regions within urban context. In this work, we introduce an interactive visual analysis approach, EcoLens, that allows analysts to progressively explore and analyze the complex dynamic segmentation patterns of a city using traffic data. We propose an extended non-negative Matrix Factorization based algorithm smoothed over both spatial and temporal dimensions to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the city. The algorithm also ensures the orthogonality of its result to facilitate the interpretation of different patterns. A suite of visualizations is designed to illustrate the dynamics of city segmentation and the corresponding interactions are added to support the exploration of the segmentation patterns over time. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system via case studies using a real-world dataset and a qualitative interview with the domain expert.},

This index has multiple names in the literature, including infrared index (II), normalized difference infrared index (NDII), normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), land surface water index (LSWI) and normalized burn ratio (NBR). After reviewing each term's definition, associated sensors and channel specifications, we found that the index consists of three variants, differing only in the SWIR region (1.2\textendash 1.3, 1.55\textendash 1.75 or 2.05\textendash 2.45 {$\mu$}m). Thus, three terms are sufficient to represent these three SWIR variants; other names are redundant and therefore unnecessary. Considering the spectral representativeness, the term's popularity and the `rule of priority' in scientific nomenclature, NDWI, NDII and NBR, each corresponding to the three SWIR regions, are more preferable terms.}

In this paper, we evaluate potential livelihood impacts of the CAR and programs that facilitate CAR registration. We do so by developing a conceptual framework and using evidence from semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders including farmers, governments, and funding agencies. We find that while the CAR and programs facilitating CAR do not have explicit livelihood impact goals, they nonetheless affect livelihoods, both positively and negatively, depending on the initial amount of natural vegetation on farmers' properties, farmers' access to credit and infrastructure, and changing market conditions. We argue that environmental interventions and policies need to consider potential livelihood impacts, especially if the policy intervention area has high poverty rates.},

  abstract = {Because municipal needs are unique in many respects their pavement management systems should be suited to the particular requirements involved. This paper describes the basic components of such a system, and the development of some of the key technology required. Specific consideration is given to the urban portion of the network. The investigation was primarily concerned with determining investment priorities on a network basis, rather than with sophisticated, within-project design. A priority modelling approach, recognizing the requirements of a municipal pavement management system, has been developed. This approach incorporated the development of a user-related Urban Serviceability Index (US) measure, and a performance prediction model which uses USI and various pavement classes. The performance prediction model can be applied to alternative improvement strategies and the priorities to be applied to these strategies can be determined through an optimization model. A key feature of the optimization model is its ability to evaluate trade-offs associated with project timing and scheduling. The model is tested with a case application to the arterial pavement network of the City of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Refs.},

The main focus is to introduce Intelligence and Strategic Reconnaissance (ISR) capability in an Unmanned Aircraft System to be operated in a realistic urban environment with capabilities of controlled flight within the obstruction - electromagnetic, and atmospheric (turbulence and wind shear). The design concept incorporates the challenges posed by urban landscape as well as ensures the operation of the UAS with existing military and law enforcement personnel and equipment with minimal additional training or unique equipment. The paper explains the unique design features of the fixed wing UAS, especially the ability for short take-off and landing in an urban environment with a constraint of free space. The UAS also provides high endurance for sustained surveillance and its capability is further enhanced by its elevated payload fraction. The variation in payloads and operating conditions along with their effects on the performance of the UAS are studied. The efficacy of this UAS can be demonstrated by the fact that a small UAS of this size can carry all the major technologies otherwise available on some of the most well-known UAS. New design methodologies along with conventional systems engineering practices coupled with in-depth analysis through simulations are attempted to reduce the empty weight fraction below the conventional trend line values. Studies also include test on safety, reliability, redundancy of the avionics and the communication systems in an urban environment. The UAS is currently under development at the Delhi Technological University as a Lockheed Martin sponsored research project.},

  abstract = {Malaria and other vector borne diseases claim lives and cause illness, especially in less developed countries. Although well understood methods, such as spraying and insecticidal nets, are identified as effective deterrents to malaria transmission by mosquitoes, the nations that have the greatest burden from the disease also struggle to deploy such measures sufficiently. More targeted and up to date information is needed to identify which regions of malaria-endemic countries are most likely to be at risk of malaria in the near future. This will allow national governments, local officials and public health workers to deploy protective equipment and personnel where they are most needed. This paper explores the role of environmental data generated via satellite remote sensing as an ingredient to a Malaria Early Warning System. Data from remote sensing satellites can cover broad geographical areas frequently and consistently. Much of the relevant data may be accessed by malaria-endemic countries at minimal cost via international data sharing polices. While previous research studies have demonstrated the potential to assign malaria risk to a geographic region based on indicators from satellites and other sources, there is still a need to deploy such tools in a broader and more operational manner to inform decision making on malaria management. This paper describes current research on the use of satellite-based environmental data to predict malaria risk and examines the barriers and opportunities for implementing Malaria Early Warning Systems enabled by satellite remote sensing. A Systems Architecture Framework analyses the components of a Malaria Early Warning System and highlights the need for effective coordination across public and private sector organizations.},

The purpose of this paper is to develop a perspective of the state of the SoSE field and identify challenges for future evolution. To achieve this purpose, the paper is organised to explore four primary areas. First, the literature is reviewed to provide an account of the current state of the field. Second, an organising framework is presented to structure understanding of field development. Third, a set of challenges to forward movement of the field is offered. Fourth, the paper concludes with reflections on the SoSE methodology presented in this volume and implications for further development of the SoSE field.}

Models, integrating different system processes into a unified framework, are seen as useful tools to help analyse alternatives with stakeholders, assess their outcomes, and communicate results in a transparent way. This paper reviews five common approaches or model types that have the capacity to integrate knowledge by developing models that can accommodate multiple issues, values, scales and uncertainty considerations, as well as facilitate stakeholder engagement. The approaches considered are: systems dynamics, Bayesian networks, coupled component models, agent-based models and knowledge-based models (also referred to as expert systems). We start by discussing several considerations in model development, such as the purpose of model building, the availability of qualitative versus quantitative data for model specification, the level of spatio-temporal detail required, and treatment of uncertainty. These considerations and a review of applications are then used to develop a framework that aims to assist modellers and model users in the choice of an appropriate modelling approach for their integrated assessment applications and that enables more effective learning in interdisciplinary settings.},

Some Americans insist that we're living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and well in America--it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit. In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis. As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial inequities. In shedding light on this history, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope. Praise for Stamped from the Beginning: "We often describe a wonderful book as 'mind-blowing' or 'life-changing' but I've found this rarely to actually be the case.

  abstract = {In 2007, the National Research Council's committee on Extending Observations and Research Results to Practical Applications recommended that NASA's Applied Science Program (ASP) directly engage with a broader community of users - not just federal agencies. Soon afterwards, scientists at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center began discussions on a collaborative research project with EMBARQ - the World Resource Institute's Center for Sustainable Transport. The discussions initially focused on how best to utilize satellite observations and atmospheric models for assessing the impact of a proposed transportation project on land use and air quality. Discussions exposed the participants to a broad spectrum of science and policy challenges that these diverse organizations face on a routine basis. It brought into clear focus the need for an observation-modeling system that will allow a proactive approach towards development planning, and the fact that satellite systems do not always provide the spatial and temporal resolution useful for urban-scale applications, underscoring the need for earth system models to bridge this gap. Realizing the significant risk that unplanned urbanization and climate change pose to the social and functional stability of large cities, both organizations decided to expand the scope of their preliminary discussion to include water resources and agriculture. A pilot project, funded by NASA ASP, EMBARQ and Istanbul Technical University focused on quantifying the magnitude and extent of urbanization in Istanbul, and analyzed the combined effect of urbanization and projected climate change on local climate, air quality, and its consequent effects on agricultural productivity. Preliminary results show that Istanbul has undergone a significant amount of Land Use/Land Cover change over the past two decades. While some forested areas have been lost to urban-landscapes, urbanization has mostly occurred over former croplands due to the fact that in contrast to forested areas, croplands have flat terrain, making them a more attractive target for conversion to urban land. The reduction in land area for agricultural and increase in temperature has reduced agricultural production in the vicinity of the city. The United Nations expects the world population to reach 9.2 billion by 2050. Most of this increase will be absorbed by countries that are least able to sustain it. Rapid economic growth is likely to continue and will require massive infrastructure investments. If not properly managed, the magnitude and extent of these initiatives will overwhelm sensitive ecosystems around the world. Successful relationships such as the one described here are critically important if we are to stabilize the threatened ecosystems on which human systems ultimately rely. The challenges, needs, culture, and operating environment of development planning organizations are fundamentally different from a research organization. An appreciation of these differences is a prerequisite for any successful collaboration.},

The latter two entities have been neglected in the past, because engineers and planners have drawn heavily from the methods and practice of operations research, systems engineering, and the power of quantitative methods to ``solve'' practically all urban-planning\textendash related problems. The overall results of the use of these ``hard systems'' methodologies (HSM) have not been uniformly successful, except in dealing with the simpler cases. In this paper the ``soft systems'' methodology (SSM) is explained in detail, showing how it can be applied to problems concerned with rational intervention in human activity systems. SSM is an inquiring system used for tackling ill-structured, messy problem situations in engineering and planning. In practice, HSM and SSM complement and supplement each other. An example applied to a transportation planning situation is included. This methodology has proven to be effective and easy to use.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the state of ``critical cartography'' which is being experimented with exuberance in a number of disciplines and arenas: geographers, community development activists, artists, and new media innovators, to name a few. The promise and possibilities of debunking and retooling cartography are significant: by opening up who can make a map and the kinds of maps that are made, overlooked phenomena can be reclaimed, different perspectives can be made apparent, and new knowledge constructed. However, the conditions under which the emancipatory potential of critical cartography might be realized need to be investigated. This article critiques the claims that current new mapping practices increase participation and democracy and outlines four issues critical cartography needs to further develop in order to increase its potential: 1) greater reflexivity on the critical cartographer's own position and influence of the project, 2) acknowledgement of the choices made of what not to include in the map, 3) greater consideration about the politics of aesthetics, 4) expanded search for deeper social engagement with new mapping projects. The article also discusses these issues through a case study map project of street vendors contesting the use of sidewalk space in Ho Chi Minh City. It explores the qualities a non-participatory, authored map project might engender critical visualization through processes of spatial ethnography.},

This paper focuses on one such challenge: characterizing the fraction of vehicles which have received a message, as a function of space and time, and operating under different traffic and communication conditions. V2V technologies bridge two infrastructures: communication and transportation. These infrastructures are interconnected and interdependent. To capture this inter-dependence, which may vary in time and space, we propose a new methodology for modeling information propagation between V2V-enabled vehicles. The model is based on a continuous-time Markov chain which is shown to converge, under appropriate conditions, to a set of clustered epidemiological differential equations. The fraction of vehicles which have received a message, as a function of space and time may be obtained as a solution of these differential equations, which can be solved efficiently, independently of the number of vehicles. Such characterizations can form the basis of assessing several attributes of V2V systems, some of which we demonstrate. The characterizations lend themselves to a variety of generalizations and capture various interdependencies between communication and mobility. As tests of the model we provide applications both in real-world settings using microscopic traffic traces and in postulated scenarios of outages and system perturbations: we find good model agreement with microscopic trajectory from two actual trajectory datasets, as well as a synthetic trajectory dataset generated from the origin/destination matrix.},

  abstract = {V2V technologies bridge two infrastructures: the communications infrastructure and the transportation infrastructure. These infrastructures are interconnected and interdependent. On the one hand, the communications network enables V2V interactions, while, on the other hand, the density of vehicles on the roadway enabled with V2V and the level of congestion on the roadway determine the speed and quality of communications between vehicles and infrastructure. The V2V technology is expected to contribute significantly to the growth of shared mobility, in turn, receives a significant boost from the deployment of a large number of connected vehicles in shared mobility services, provided challenges towards the deployment can be overcome. Vehicle mobility patterns and communication conditions are not only heterogeneous, but they also evolve constantly, leading to dynamic coupling between the communication and the transportation infrastructure. We consider the communication of messages amongst the vehicles in a transportation network, and estimate how quickly messages spread under different conditions of traffic density (traffic congestion, the presence of an accident, and time of day such as morning and evening rush hour) and communication conditions. We developed a continuous-time Markov chain to describe the information propagation process through enabled vehicles. Our models converge to a solution of a set of clustered epidemiological differential equations which lend itself to fast computation. We then demonstrate the applicability of this model in various scenarios: both real-world scenarios and hypothesized scenarios of outages and system perturbations. We find that our models match actual trajectory data with very little error, demonstrating the applicability of our models to study the spread of information through a network of connected vehicles.},

We illustrate the relevance by a case at the municipal level that shows the relevance of acceptance, pluralism, distributed agency, context, and process aspects. The municipality is still in a phase of exploration and conceptualization. Systems Engineering can be of great value in this phase to explore the problem and solution space. However, to make the most of this requires that Systems Engineering addresses policy making, distributed agency, and complexity. We discuss the challenges this poses for the traditional Systems Engineering approach; we indicate several potential strategies to address these challenges, and we show two fields that can help clarify how to address these challenges: transition studies and sustainability assessment.},

Recent studies showed that a replacement of the current vehicles through autonomous vehicles would help in reducing these emissions. A radical replacement is not possible. The actual infrastructure needs to be extended by technologies that facilitate autonomous driving. Therefor integration of knowhow from other domains like internet of things, big data analysis or transportation planning has to be considered. This paper presents a smart service where, based on the information provided by principals of industry 4.0 and internet of things, the planning of an autonomous grocery delivery fleet occurs.

  abstract = {Our current knowledge on production, composition, transport, pathways and transformations of organic carbon in tropical mangrove environments is reviewed and discussed. Organic carbon entering mangrove foodwebs is either produced autochthonously or imported by tides and/or rivers. Mangrove litter and benthic microalgae are usually the most important autochthonous carbon sources. Depending on local conditions, phytoplankton and seagrass detritus imported with tides may represent a significant supplementary carbon input. Litter handling by the fauna not only affects microbial carbon transformations, but also the amount of organic carbon available for export. Most mangrove detritus that enters the sediment is degraded by microorganisms. Aerobic respiration and anaerobic sulfate reduction are usually considered the most important microbial respiration processes, but recent evidence suggests that iron respiration may be important in mangrove sediments as well. Organic carbon that escapes microbial degradation is stored in sediments and in some mangrove ecosystems, organic-rich sediments may extend to several meters depth. Many mangrove forests also lose a significant fraction of their net primary production to coastal waters. Large differences occur between mangrove forests with respect to litter production and export. Mangrove-derived DOC is also released into the water column and can add to the total organic carbon export. Numerous compounds have been characterized from mangrove tissues, including carbohydrates, amino acids, lignin-derived phenols, tannins, fatty acids, triterpenoids and n-alkanes. Many of these may, together with stable isotopes, exhibit a strong source signature and are potentially useful tracers of mangrove-derived organic matter. Our knowledge on mangrove carbon dynamics has improved considerably in recent years, but there are still significant gaps and shortcomings. These are emphasized and relevant research directions are suggested.},

While flood protection measures may reduce the frequency of inundation losses, appropriate preparedness measures lessen the residual financial risk considerably. Besides public and private measures, insurance is a key factor in reducing the financial risk for individuals, enterprises, and even whole societies. In recent years, the demand for flood insurance has been growing. This is forcing the insurance industry to develop appropriate solutions. At the same time it is vital for the insurers to know the probable maximum losses they might face as the result of an extreme event.}

The data flows that condition much of our lives now regularly include Global Positioning System (GPS) readings and satellite images of a quality once reserved for a few militaries and intelligence agencies, and powerful geographic information system (GIS) software is now commonplace. These new technologies have raised fundamental questions about the intersection between physical space and its representation, virtual space and its realization. In Close Up at a Distance, Laura Kurgan offers a theoretical account of these new digital technologies of location and a series of practical experiments in making maps and images with spatial data. Neither simply useful tools nor objects of wonder or anxiety, the technologies of GPS, GIS, and satellite imagery become, in this book, the subject and the medium of a critical exploration. Close Up at a Distance records situations of intense conflict and struggle, on the one hand, and fundamental transformations in our ways of seeing and of experiencing space, on the other. Kurgan maps and theorizes mass graves, incarceration patterns, disappearing forests, and currency flows in a series of cases that range from Kuwait (1991) to Kosovo (1999), New York (2001) to Indonesia (2010). Using digital spatial hardware and software designed for military and governmental use in reconnaissance, secrecy, monitoring, ballistics, the census, and national security, Kurgan engages and confronts the politics and complexities of these technologies and their uses. At the intersection of art, architecture, activism, and geography, she uncovers, in her essays and projects, the opacities inherent in the recording of information and data and reimagines the spaces they have opened up.},

We describe the Cynefin framework, a sense-making device we have developed to help people make sense of the complexities made visible by the relaxation of these assumptions. The Cynefin framework is derived from several years of action research into the use of narrative and complexity theory in organizational knowledge exchange, decision making, strategy and policy making. The framework is explained, its conceptual underpinnings are outlined, and its use in group sense-making and discourse is described. Finally, the consequences of relaxing the three basic assumptions, using the Cynefin framework as a mechanism, are considered. Over the past several years our group has been conducting a program of disruptive action research using the methods of narrative and of complexity theory to address critical business issues (see e.g., Snowden 1999b). We started work in the areas of knowledge management, cultural change and community dynamics; expanded into product development, market creation and branding; and have in recent years been working increasingly in the area of national and organizational strategy. Some of this work has been directly funded by the U.S. government through DARPA as well as by other government agencies, in particular in Singapore, which are interested in new approaches to supporting policy making. The central element of our approach is the Cynefin framework for sense-making. In this paper we will describe the framework and its conceptual basis, and we will detail some of its uses for sense-making to support decision making in varied dynamical contexts.},

Additionally, mangrove ecosystems represent one of the most concentrated carbon reservoirs that are rapidly degrading as a result of deforestation, development, and hydrologic manipulation. Therefore, the accuracy of Canopy Height Models (CHM) over mangrove forest can provide crucial information for monitoring and verification protocols. We compared four CHMs derived from independent remotely sensed imagery and identified potential errors and bias between measurement types. CHMs were derived from three spaceborne datasets; Very-High Resolution (VHR) stereophotogrammetry, TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (TanDEM-X), and lidar data which was acquired from an airborne platform. Each dataset exhibited different error characteristics that were related to spatial resolution, sensitivities of the sensors, and reference frames. Canopies over 10 m were accurately predicted by all CHMs while the distributions of canopy height were best predicted by the VHR CHM. Depending on the guidelines and strategies needed for monitoring and verification activities, coarse resolution CHMs could be used to track canopy height at regional and global scales with finer resolution imagery used to validate and monitor critical areas undergoing rapid changes.},

  abstract = {Demand for mangrove forest resources has led to a steady decline in mangrove area over the past century. Land conversions in the form of agriculture, aquaculture and urbanization account for much of the deforestation of mangrove wetlands. However, natural processes at the transition zone between land and ocean can also rapidly change mangrove spread. In this study, we applied a robust field-based carbon inventory and new structural and temporal remote sensing techniques to quantify the magnitude and change of mangrove carbon stocks in major deltas across Africa and Asia. From 2000\textendash 2016, approximately 1.6\% (12 270 ha) of the total mangrove area within these deltas disappeared, primarily through erosion and conversion to agriculture. However, the rapid expansion of mangroves in some regions during this same period resulted in new forests that were taller and more carbon-dense than the deforested areas. Because of the rapid vertical growth rates and horizontal expansion, new mangrove forests were able to offset the total carbon losses of 5 332 843 Mg C by 44\%. Each hectare of new mangrove forest accounted for {$\sim$}84\% to {$\sim$}160\% of the aboveground carbon for each hectare of mangrove forest lost, regardless of the net change in mangrove area. Our study highlights the significance of the natural dynamics of erosion and sedimentation on carbon loss and sequestration potential for mangroves over time. Areas of naturally regenerating mangroves will have a much larger carbon sequestration potential if the rate of mangrove deforestation of taller forests is curbed.},

However, there are many challenges that are needed to overcome before deploying UAVs. These challenges comprise not only technical issues, but also regulation issues. In this paper, a UAV-based architecture of value-added IoT services from the sky will be introduced. In order to develop the UAV-based value-added IoT service from the sky, a multirotor UAV was setup with the capability of wireless communication technologies. The selected wireless technologies are cellular 4G long term evolution (LTE) and Wi-Fi. A cloud platform, named DRONE Hatch, was adopted. The core technology of the proposed architecture is that the UAV mission can be executed totally from DRONE Hatch without the help of any pilot using a remote controller. The test results of the integrated platform show that it is viable to develop the value-added IoT service from the sky.  2018, The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of the Republic of China.

The methods are inclusive of stakeholder values and accounts for deep uncertainties in governance, security, economy, environment, workforce, and other topics. The methods are applied in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province to assist in the selection among twenty-seven candidate infrastructure projects that are vulnerable to potential refugee immigration among other emergent conditions.

  abstract = {The book covers a wide variety of applied operations research in a way not seen elsewhere. With an emphasis on model building, not theorem proving, the book starts with a review applied probability and contains material on geometrical probability not easily accessible elsewhere. Spatial as well as temporal Poisson processes are covered in depth. Then the applied probability is put to good use in a chapter devoted to queueing models. This is a stand-alone introduction to queueing theory that may be useful in a variety of courses, just as the geometrical probability segment has stand-alone value. The next chapter is a unique tour of spatial queues, combining geometrical probability concepts with models of queues from previous chapters. The core of the chapter is development of the Hypercube Queueing model, a model that -- 31 years after its original development -- remains the gold standard in modeling municipal emergency services such as police, emergency medical and fire departments. The homework problems at the end of this chapter are the most challenging in the book, many worthy of the most advanced doctoral students. The book then shifts slightly from primarily probabilistic models to a combination of probabilistic and deterministic models, focusing on transportation networks analysis. This graph-focused chapter develops rigorous results by intuitive visual arguments, not abstract algebraic theorem proving. It too is a stand-alone chapter, the longest and most comprehensive in the book. There follows a brief chapter on the theory and mechanics of Monte Carlo simulation. This is good material even for people who use packaged simulation software, as it focuses on fundamentals and issues to think about even when using packaged software. The book concludes with a unique chapter on implementation, based on the personal experiences of the authors and their students in attempting to implement the models, methods and philosophies of the book.},

CA macro-models used to simulate the quantitative land-use change (LUC) for urban areas are, thus far, lacking profound dynamics driven by demographic change. The model presented in this paper focuses on household dynamics according to the concept of the second demographic transition (SDT), applying aging and population shrinkage to simulate respective effects on residential choice and the resulting LUC. Such a perspective becomes especially important for urban areas exhibiting growth and shrinkage simultaneously, as currently seen in cities in Europe and in the U.S. To analyze this simultaneity in detail, we implement the residential land use CA model Metronamica and apply it to Berlin's metropolitan region, which was selected as a typical example that displays contrasting growth and shrinkage processes. The pre-implemented macro-model has been replaced with our new SD model H2DCA (Household Decision Dynamics for Cellular Automata). For the simulation, we used empirical census data, economic data, data on residential satisfaction and numerous types of geo-information representing land-use zoning, accessibility and suitability for the time span 1990\textendash 2008. A comparison of a null model (NM) and H2DCA provides a very satisfying reproduction of land-use patterns reflected by kappa coefficient values. The causal relation of LUC drivers is considerably improved by sophisticated housing choice-feedback mechanisms. Although specific residential land-use classes exhibit shrinkage, others expand. Due to the detailed residential land-use classification, current re-urbanization processes could also be simulated.},

  abstract = {As one of the most prevailing retail channels, E-commerce has nowadays facilitated retailers to sell goods to customers worldwide and tremendously increased the supply chain efficiency by removing most intermediate links. The broaden business scope and accelerated goods circulation, nevertheless, have generally led to capital shortages for retailers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Given the SMEs' difficulty in acquiring capital from financial institutions such as banks, logistics finance (LF) has emerged as an alternative, which is the combination of logistics and financial service. However, the frequent order fulfillment and diversity of pledges in E-commerce hinder SMEs in meeting LF's financing requirements. Furthermore, the current LF relies more on large and reputable third-party logistics (3PLs) to alleviate financing risks, which in turn raises the entry threshold for other 3PLs. Hence, this paper has proposed a blockchain-enabled logistics finance execution platform (BcLFEP) as an integrated solution to facilitate LF for E-commerce retail. A cross-layered architecture is proposed to organize and manage involved resources, workflows and decisions based on the object-oriented methodology (OOM). A hybrid finite state machine-based smart contract (HFSM-SC) is designed to associate and coordinate with all kinds of agents for LF operations throughout its lifecycle. Moreover, blockchain is integrated with agent technology to construct a blockchain-enabled multi-agent system (BcMAS), providing a trusted runtime environment to more autonomously and efficiently execute smart contract. Finally, a case study is conducted to implement BcLFEP-enabled dynamic pledge management for verification and evaluation.},

Although its interruption may cause serious consequences, researching its robustness doesn't attract attention until recent years. Based on previous researches on the issue, this paper proposes a comprehensive method to assess the robustness of high-speed rail network (HSRN) by combining the network function features with network topology features and modeling HSRN as a two-layer network based on the high-speed trains running in the network, in which the travel time and passenger flow are taken into account. Finally, taking China's HSRN (CHSRN) as a case study, this paper investigates the failure effects of HSR stations and high-speed trains on the robustness of CHSRN, especially the space-time failure effects of high-speed trains at three typical HSR stations. Results reveal that the failure effects of trains at the selected stations on the performance of CHSRN are limited, and the failure effects of trains at three typical stations on the performance are different as the different failure time, which is beneficial to prioritize the decisions on maintenance resource allocation and prepare emergency response plans.},

  abstract = {Agricultural actions usually involve a decision process collaborating different decision makers and officers. Different decision process may encounter different difficulties depending on the type of actions. In order to make efficient progress in actions, a support system for decision making should be constructed to include not only supporting information for the decision, but also tools for decision management. For such decision support and management system, enhancement in task communication, data summarizing and subtask management should be the focus of the development. In this study, we used MAKOCI (Multi-Agent Knowledge Oriented CyberInfrastructure) as a geospatial platform to convey customized decision knowledge, working procedures, and data processing capability, where ontology and multi-agent are implemented to facilitate modularized application design. A case study on detection and responses of agricultural heavy-metal contamination is given in this study to exemplify the functions of the decision support system designed. By the proposed design, the spatial decision support system facilitates hierarchical task definition and cross-government communications, in addition to supporting spatial and non-spatial decisional information. The decision progress can consequently be enhanced by monitoring, communication and management of actions among partaking users of the system.},

From systems analysis to reconnaissance satellites to think tanks, these innovations did not remain exclusive accessories of the defense establishment. Instead, they readily found civilian applications in both the private and public sector. City planning and management were no exception. Jennifer Light argues that the technologies and values of the Cold War fundamentally shaped the history of postwar urban America. From Warfare to Welfare documents how American intellectuals, city leaders, and the federal government chose to attack problems in the nation's cities by borrowing techniques and technologies first designed for military engagement with foreign enemies. Experiments in urban problem solving adapted the expertise of defense professionals to face new threats: urban chaos, blight, and social unrest. Tracing the transfer of innovations from military to city planning and management, Light reveals how a continuing source of inspiration for American city administrators lay in the nation's preparations for war.},

However, effective planning may encounter difficulties since uncertainties existing in a number of impact factors and pollution-related processes are often not well acknowledged and reflected. Combining chance-constrained programming and fuzzy credibility-constrained programming with interval parameters and stochastic programming, this study advances an inexact stochastic\textendash fuzzy jointed chance-constrained programming method for planning regional economic and environmental systems under multiple uncertainties presented as intervals, fuzzy sets and probability distributions. The developed method has been applied to a case of long-term energy management system with multiple energy resources and three communities. Emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are controlled and capacity expansion is scheduled. The results can help to identify desired alternatives for planning regional development strategies, where compromised schemes are provided under an integrated consideration of economic efficiency and environmental protection under multiple uncertainties.},

For business and technology to develop, cities need to attract talented people from other cities and countries. Until now, talent research has mainly focused on talent development in organizations and little on talent attraction in big cities. The topicality of this chapter is a research of the situation on attracting talent in cities with a population between 20,000 and 50,000. This article identifies the factors that are important to talented people in deciding to move to another city. The research is a case study of the economically developing city of Valmiera in Latvia with a population of 23,063. The study included 28 in-depth semi-structured interviews and the university alumni survey (n-81). The results reveal that the differences in choice factors are mainly determined by the stage of human life\textemdash the beginning, middle or maturity of family life and career. The literature research indicates a major role of the international dimension in attracting talent. The research shows that the respondents mentally support openness and the acceptance of strangers, but these statements are contradictory to the positive attitude in the feelings towards a ``small, family-like, familiar, safe'' city.},

In particular, we assume consumers purchase these solar panels according to a discrete choice model. The technology adoption process is reinforced by network externalities such as imitating customer behavior and cost improvements through learning-by-doing. Using this model, we develop a framework for policy makers to find optimal subsidies in order to achieve a desired adoption target with minimum cost for the system. We discuss the structure of the optimal subsidy policy and how the overall system cost changes with the adoption target. Furthermore, we validate the model through an empirical study of the German solar market, where we estimate the model parameters, generate adoption forecasts and demonstrate how to solve the policy design problem. We use this framework to show that the current policies in Germany are not efficient. In particular, our study suggests that their subsidies should be higher in the near future and the gradual phase-out of the subsidies should occur faster. History : First draft},

  abstract = {The factors that account for the differences in the economic productivity of urban areas have remained difficult to measure and identify unambiguously. Here we show that a microscopic derivation of urban scaling relations for economic quantities vs. population, obtained from the consideration of social and infrastructural properties common to all cities, implies an effective model of economic output in the form of a Cobb-Douglas type production function. As a result we derive a new expression for the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of urban areas, which is the standard measure of economic productivity per unit of aggregate production factors (labor and capital). Using these results we empirically demonstrate that there is a systematic dependence of urban productivity on city population size, resulting from the mismatch between the size dependence of wages and labor, so that in contemporary US cities productivity increases by about 11\% with each doubling of their population. Moreover, deviations from the average scale dependence of economic output, capturing the effect of local factors, including history and other local contingencies, also manifest surprising regularities. Although, productivity is maximized by the combination of high wages and low labor input, high productivity cities show invariably high wages and high levels of employment relative to their size expectation. Conversely, low productivity cities show both low wages and employment. These results shed new light on the microscopic processes that underlie urban economic productivity, explain the emergence of effective aggregate urban economic output models in terms of labor and capital inputs and may inform the development of economic theory related to growth.},

These forest and water resources face environmental threats such as river contamination, salmon (a key Yurok food source) depletion , unsustainable logging practices, forest fires, and droughts. Efforts by the Yurok to conserve their resources include conservation-based forest management and restoration of the Klamath river through the removal of hydroelectric dams upstream. Yurok leaders are faced with complex decisions including where to allocate limited resources to river restoration post-dam removal, or how to balance revenue, resilience, and cultural values in forest management practices - all while considering the needs of multiple stakeholders. The authors are employing Earth Observation (EO) analyses and the Environment-Vulnerability-Decision-Technology (EVDT) integrated modeling framework to develop decision support systems (DSS) to support Yurok natural resource management. The EVDT framework considers the interactions between the environment, socioeconomic impacts, human decision-making, and technology design to develop accessible DSS that incorporate EO analyses. These DSS will allow decision-makers to examine analyses of historical EO data related to environmental and socioeconomic domains and explore the relationships between these factors under different simulated conditions to evaluate potential policies or investments. This work describes stakeholder engagement in the development of these EO analyses and DSS through the use of interviews, system architecture, and methods drawing on the SERVIR Service Planning Toolkit. Additionally, the work highlights preliminary efforts to develop specific EO analyses (including analyzing tree height and fires in Yurok forests, or surface water extent in the Klamath river) as well as the incorporation of these analyses into the prototype DSS software tool.},

  abstract = {Coastal flooding and land subsidence threaten the community of Pekalongan City, Indonesia. These environmental phenomena threaten coastal ecosystems, but also cause extensive economic damage and threaten agriculture and aquaculture industries. When addressing these environmental and socioeconomic challenges, local leaders are faced with the needs of multiple stakeholders as well as decisions on where and how to allocate limited resources to flood mitigation techniques (such as mangrove forest planting or human-made techniques such as sea walls). The coastal phenomena affecting Pekalongan City - such as flooding and land subsidence, as well as the effects these phenomena have on socioeconomic factors (such as agriculture, fisheries, and transportation) represent a complex system as defined in the aerospace System Engineering literature and are also challenging to the mental models of human decision-makers. This work employs Systems Architecture analysis to analyze options for how researchers from universities in the United States can help supplement the work of local leaders to improve coastal resilience in Pekalongan City. Systems Architecture Framework is well suited to this complex system and is employed to evaluate the Context (such as intersecting environmental and socioeconomic factors), analyze Stakeholders (which entails a complex network of local and national governments, NGOs, and universities), assess Stakeholder Needs and Objectives (which relate to economic stability, public health, and environmental restoration), and consider potential Functions and Forms (which could make use of the benefits of techniques from the aerospace field such as satellite remote sensing (SRS) data analyses and integrated modeling) to provide decision support for coastal resilience. This effort focuses on addressing the Function of aiding local decision makers in understanding environmental phenomena, related socioeconomic impacts, and potential policy options and technology investments by analyzing potential Forms for decision support. The results of this Systems Architecture analysis conclude that the intersecting sociotechnical factors of the complex system of coastal flooding in Pekalongan City necessitate an integrated modeling framework to support the decision making of local leaders. Researchers in the United States propose to use the Environment-Vulnerability-Decision-Technology (EVDT) integrated modeling framework as a form to address this function. EVDT considers the interactions between the Environment, Societal Impact, Human Decision-Making, and Technology Design to support decision-making. The EVDT framework is being applied to develop an accessible, Decision Support System (DSS) employing additional Forms of integrated modeling and SRS data analyses to support decision makers. The goal of applying EVDT and employing SRS data to develop this DSS is to aid leaders by helping them understand complex relationships between these disparate societal factors, adapt to changes within the community, and address the needs of multiple stakeholders. The EVDT framework is being utilized to develop a DSS that outputs descriptive and predictive models (which utilize inputs of both SRS data and local socioeconomic information). These models allow decision makers to examine historical data and explore the relationships between these interrelated societal factors under different simulated conditions to evaluate potential policies or technological investments. This work describes the System Architecture analysis and how EVDT is a Form well suited to address the Stakeholder Needs, Objectives, and Desired Outcomes resulting from this analysis. This work also provides a description of initial efforts to develop a DSS prototype informed by inputs from the System Architecture analysis and employing EVDT and SRS data analyses.},

Recent years have indeed assisted in drawing attention to the human-centric design of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and to the genesis of the `Operator 4.0', two novel concepts that raise significant ethical questions regarding the impact of technology on workers and society at large. This paper argues that a value-oriented and ethical technology engineering in Industry 5.0 is an urgent and sensitive topic as demonstrated by a survey administered to industry leaders from different companies. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is proposed as a principled framework to illustrate how technologies enabling human\textendash machine symbiosis in the Factory of the Future can be designed to embody elicited human values and to illustrate actionable steps that engineers and designers can take in their design projects. Use cases based on real solutions and prototypes discuss how a design-for-values approach aids in the investigation and mitigation of ethical issues emerging from the implementation of technological solutions and, hence, support the migration to a symbiotic Factory of the Future.},

Numerous studies have been undertaken to describe and measure the value of the data from these spacecraft in order to justify further investments. The studies use a wide variety of methods and generally find a large range of benefits, from quite small to very large, in part because of differences in methodologies. This article offers a general framework for measuring the value of information. The framework serves two purposes. One is provision of a comprehensive and common basis by which to conduct and evaluate studies of the value of earth science. The second is to better inform decision makers about the value of data. Decision makers comprise three communities: consumers and producers of information, public officials whose job is to invest in data acquisition and information development (including sensors and other hardware, algorithm design and software tools, and a trained labor force), and the public at large. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The use of terms such as ``Engineering Systems'', ``System of systems'' and others have been coming into greater use over the past decade to denote systems of importance but with implied higher complexity than for the term systems alone. This paper searches for a useful taxonomy or classification scheme for complex Systems. There are two aspects to this problem: 1) distinguishing between Engineering Systems (the term we use) and other Systems, and 2) differentiating among Engineering Systems. Engineering Systems are found to be differentiated from other complex systems by being human-designed and having both significant human complexity as well as significant technical complexity. As far as differentiating among various engineering systems, it is suggested that functional type is the most useful attribute for classification differentiation. Information, energy, value and mass acted upon by various processes are the foundation concepts underlying the technical types.},

  abstract = {If engineering is the art and science of technical problem solving, systems architecting happens when you don't yet know what the problem is. The third edition of a highly respected bestseller, The Art of Systems Architecting provides in-depth coverage of the least understood part of systems design: moving from a vague concept and limited resources to a satisfactory and feasible system concept and an executable program. The book provides a practical, heuristic approach to the "art" of systems architecting. It provides methods for embracing, and then taming, the growing complexity of modern systems. New in the Third Edition:   Five major case studies illustrating successful and unsuccessful practices Information on architecture frameworks as standards for architecture descriptions New methods for integrating business strategy and architecture and the role of architecture as the technical embodiment of strategy Integration of process guidance for organizing and managing architecture projects Updates to the rapidly changing fields of software and systems-of-systems architecture Organization of heuristics around a simple and practical process model  ~A Practical Heuristic Approach to the Art of Systems Architecting Extensively rewritten to reflect the latest developments, the text explains how to create a system from scratch, presenting invention/design rules together with clear explanations of how to use them. The author supplies practical guidelines for avoiding common systematic failures while implementing new mandates. He uses a heuristics-based approach that provides an organized attack on very ill-structured engineering problems. Examining architecture as more than a set of diagrams and documents, but as a set of decisions that either drive a system to success or doom it to failure, the book provide methods for integrating business strategy with technical architectural decision making.},

  abstract = {A highly uncertain future due to changes in climate, technology and socio-economics has led to the realisation that identification of ``best-guess'' future conditions might no longer be appropriate. Instead, multiple plausible futures need to be considered, which requires (i) uncertainties to be described with the aid of scenarios that represent coherent future pathways based on different sets of assumptions, (ii) system performance to be represented by metrics that measure insensitivity (i.e. robustness) to changes in future conditions, and (iii) adaptive strategies to be considered alongside their more commonly used static counterparts. However, while these factors have been considered in isolation previously, there has been a lack of discussion of the way they are connected. In order to address this shortcoming, this paper presents a multidisciplinary perspective on how the above factors fit together to facilitate the development of strategies that are best suited to dealing with a deeply uncertain future.},

It explores approaches and tools supporting the design of strategic plans under deep uncertainty, and their testing in the real world, including barriers and enablers for their use in practice. The book broadens traditional approaches and tools to include the analysis of actors and networks related to the problem at hand. It also shows how lessons learned in the application process can be used to improve the approaches and tools used in the design process. The book offers guidance in identifying and applying appropriate approaches and tools to design plans, as well as advice on implementing these plans in the real world. For decisionmakers and practitioners, the book includes realistic examples and practical guidelines that should help them understand what decisionmaking under deep uncertainty is and how it may be of assistance to them. Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty: From Theory to Practice is divided into four parts. Part I presents five approaches for designing strategic plans under deep uncertainty: Robust Decision Making, Dynamic Adaptive Planning, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways, Info-Gap Decision Theory, and Engineering Options Analysis. Each approach is worked out in terms of its theoretical foundations, methodological steps to follow when using the approach, latest methodological insights, and challenges for improvement. In Part II, applications of each of these approaches are presented. Based on recent case studies, the practical implications of applying each approach are discussed in depth. Part III focuses on using the approaches and tools in real-world contexts, based on insights from real-world cases. Part IV contains conclusions and a synthesis of the lessons that can be drawn for designing, applying, and implementing strategic plans under deep uncertainty, as well as recommendations for future work.The publication of this book has been funded by the Radboud University, the RAND Corporation, Delft University of Technology, and Deltares.},

  title = {A {{Framework}} for {{Quantifying Complexity}} and {{Understanding}} Its {{Sources}}: {{Application}} to Two {{Large-Scale Systems}}},
  author = {Martin, Pierre-alain J Y},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {The motivation for this work is to quantify the complexity of complex systems and to understand its sources. To study complexity, we develop a theoretical framework where the complex system of interest is embedded in a broader system: a complex large-scale system. In order to understand and show how the complexity of the system is impacted by the complexity of its environment, three layers of complexity are defined: the internal complexity which is the complexity of the complex system itself, the external complexity which is the complexity of the environment of the system (i.e., the complexity of the largescale system in which the system is embedded) and the interface complexity which is defined at the interface of the system and its environment. For each complexity we suggest metrics and apply them to two examples. The examples of complex systems used are two surveillance radars: the first one is an Air Traffic Control radar, the second one is a maritime surveillance radar. The two large-scale systems in which the radars are embedded are therefore the air and the maritime transportation system. The internal complexity metrics takes into account the number of links, the number of elements, the function and hierarchy of the elements. The interface complexity metric is based upon the information content of the probability of failure of the system as it is used in its environment. The External complexity metric deals with the risk configuration of largescale systems emphasizing the reliability and the tendency to catastrophe of the system. The complexity metrics calculated based on specific analysis of the ATC radar are higher than those calculated for the maritime radar for all the three levels of complexity indicating that the external complexity is the source for the internal complexity. Thus, not surprisingly it appears that the technical complexity of a system mainly stems from the socio-political complexity of the large-scale system in which it is embedded. More interestingly, the more rigorous and quantitative complexity metrics (Internal and Interface) are approximately linearly related for these two systems. This result is potentially important enough to be tested over a wider variety of complex systems.},

The simulation was developed using the High Level Architecture (HLA), which facilitates sharing of data and synchronization of simulation time among software components on networked computers. Simulation results were validated using experimental data. The project demonstrated successful application of distributed simulation to complex naval platform systems. Lessons learned are shared for several areas, including seaway modelling, ship hydrodynamic interaction, and planning of model tests and sea trials for simulation validation. 2019: Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of National Defence},

Under the guidance of British cybernetician Stafford Beer, often lauded as the `father of management cybernetics', an interdisciplinary Chilean team designed cybernetic models of factories within the nationalised sector and created a network for the rapid transmission of economic data between the government and the factory floor.

We survey the proactive, active and passive fault diagnosis schemes that have appeared in the literature to date, accenting their advantages and limitations of each scheme.

Three sources of information were used in the study: census data, a mailed survey to obtain basic information about physical conditions and mobility limitations, and a home interview with a sample drawn from those receiving the mailed questionnaire. The survey instrument was designed to elicit information in six areas: existing travel patterns, health conditions, mobility or ability to get around, latent demand, demographic questions, and attitudes. The findings indicate that all people classified as mobility limited by conventional schemes were, regardless of label, mobile. A total of 63 percent used some form of public transportation and 19 percent actually drove themselves. Over 90 percent depended on others for transportation at least occasionally. In general, the more disabled a person was, the more that person was travel dependent on others. Three major factors with which the physically handicapped have difficulty were identified: vehicle environment, walking, and climbing. It was found that approximately 38 percent of those classed as handicapped have a significant mobility limitation. Mobility limitation varies by geographic location: 46 percent of the handicapped in urban areas are mobility limited, while 30 percent in high density suburban and 35 percent in low density suburban areas are mobility handicapped. A procedure for estimating travel demand for the handicapped was developed. Supporting data are provided in tabular form.},

We developed an innovative big data approach to derive street-level morphology and urban feature composition as experienced by a pedestrian from Google Street View (GSV) imagery. We employed a scalable deep learning framework to segment 90-degree field of view GSV image cubes into six classes: sky, trees, buildings, impervious surfaces, pervious surfaces, and non-permanent objects. We increased the classification accuracy by differentiating between three view directions (lateral, down, and up) and by introducing a void class as training label. To model the urban environment as perceived by a pedestrian in a street canyon, we projected the segmented image cubes onto spheres and evaluated the fraction of each surface class on the sphere. To demonstrate the application of our approach, we analyzed the urban form and composition of Philadelphia County and three Philadelphia neighborhoods (suburb, center city, lower income neighborhood) using stacked area graphs. Our method is fully scalable to other geographic locations and constitutes an important step towards building a global morphological database to describe the form and composition of cities from a human-centric perspective.},

ILUTE has reached a state of operational implementation in which historical validation runs are being undertaken. The model runs start with 100\% of the population of people, families, households, and dwelling units in the greater Toronto area that was synthesized for the year 1986. Twenty-year historical simulations (1986 to 2006) have been run, with model outputs being compared with Canadian census data and Transportation Tomorrow Survey data for 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006.

IUMs have been criticized over this same period on both practical and theoretical grounds. At the same time, continuing and very significant technological developments have made possible the development, implementation and use of such models in operational planning settings in various countries worldwide. A major review of the IUM state of the art and recommendations for evolution of this state were prepared by the author and colleagues 20 years ago. This paper presents an update of the 1998 report in terms of a summary of progress over the past 20 years, a critical assessment of the current IUM state of the art and practice, and needs and prospects for future development. This paper argues that the current modeling state is in "the doldrums," similar to concerns raised by Pas in the seminal 1990 critique of activity-based travel models. It then outlines research and development needs to exploit current and emerging data, computing, and methodological developments that hold promise for the development of a much more powerful and useful "next generation" of IUMs.},

Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.The second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij. One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color."Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space."\textemdash Scientific American"A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way. For that alone, it seems worthwhile."\textemdash Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times". . . witty examination of how and why maps lie. [The book] conveys an important message about how statistics of any kind can be manipulated. But it also communicates much of the challenge, aesthetic appeal, and sheer fun of maps.

  abstract = {The MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change is an organization for research, independent policy analysis, and public education in global environmental change. It seeks to provide leadership in understanding scientific, economic, and ecological aspects of this difficult issue, and combining them into policy assessments that serve the needs of ongoing national and international discussions. To this end, the Program brings together an interdisciplinary group from two established research centers at MIT: the Center for Global Change Science (CGCS) and the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR). These two centers bridge many key areas of the needed intellectual work, and additional essential areas are covered by other MIT departments, by collaboration with the Ecosystems Center of the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) at Woods Hole, and by short-and long-term visitors to the Program. The Program involves sponsorship and active participation by industry, government, and non-profit organizations. To inform processes of policy development and implementation, climate change research needs to focus on improving the prediction of those variables that are most relevant to economic, social, and environmental effects. In turn, the greenhouse gas and atmospheric aerosol assumptions underlying climate analysis need to be related to the economic, technological, and political forces that drive emissions, and to the results of international agreements and mitigation. Further, assessments of possible societal and ecosystem impacts, and analysis of mitigation strategies, need to be based on realistic evaluation of the uncertainties of climate science. This report is one of a series intended to communicate research results and improve public understanding of climate issues, thereby contributing to informed debate about the climate issue, the uncertainties, and the economic and social implications of policy alternatives. Titles in the Report Series to date are listed on the inside back cover. Abstract The electric power sector, which accounts for approximately 40\% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, will be a critical component of any policy the U.S. government pursues to confront climate change. In the context of uncertainty in future policy limiting emissions, society faces the following question: What should the electricity mix we build in the next decade look like? We can continue to focus on conventional generation or invest in low-carbon technologies. There is no obvious answer without explicitly considering the risks created by uncertainty. This research investigates socially optimal near-term electricity investment decisions under uncertainty in future policy. It employs a novel framework that models decision-making under uncertainty with learning in an economy-wide setting that can measure social welfare impacts. Specifically, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the U.S. is formulated as a two-stage stochastic dynamic program focused on decisions in the electric power sector. In modeling decision-making under uncertainty, an optimal electricity investment hedging strategy is identified. Given the experimental design, the optimal hedging strategy reduces the expected policy costs by over 50\% compared to a strategy derived using the expected value for the uncertain parameter; and by 12-400\% compared to strategies developed under a perfect foresight or myopic framework. This research also shows that uncertainty has a cost, beyond the cost of meeting a policy. Results show that uncertainty about the future policy increases the expected cost of policy by over 45\%. If political consensus can be reached and the climate science uncertainties resolved, setting clear, long-term policies can minimize expected policy costs. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that near-term investments in low-carbon technologies should be greater than what would be justified to meet near-term goals alone. Near-term low-carbon investments can lower the expected cost of future policy by developing a less carbon-intensive electricity mix, spreading the burden of emissions reductions over time, and helping to overcome technology expansion rate constraints-all of which provide future flexibility in meeting a policy. The additional near-term cost of low-carbon investments is justified by the future flexibility that such investments create. The value of this flexibility is only explicitly considered in the context of decision-making under uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Sustainable development is regarded as a pivotal factor for smart urban planning. Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is a well-known land use transportation integration (LUTI) planning method, which can fulfill sustainable development objectives. In this study, a new spatial index is developed to measure TOD levels in neighborhoods of Tehran, the capital of Iran. To develop the TOD index, several criteria and indicators are first computed using spatial analyses, before being aggregated using a fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP). The fuzzy-AHP method generates three types of factor maps: that are optimistic, pessimistic, and moderate. This process evaluates the sensitivity of the TOD index by determining the indicators' weights from various views, or perspectives. The results of this sensitivity analysis show the robustness of results from various views. Furthermore, in order to assess the efficiency of the proposed method, the moderate TOD-level map is compared with both the level of public transit services and trip attraction in neighborhoods. This comparison shows that the TOD map has an accuracy of 77 percent in urban modeling, which verifies the efficiency of the proposed method for measuring TOD.},

We applied variance-based global sensitivity analysis for different atmospheric conditions and observation configurations. Among 23 input parameters, crown coverage, leaf area index, leaf inclination distribution function and soil moisture were found to be the most influential parameters driving the output variance of the radiance between 400 and 2500nm with a few exceptions. Hapke's soil parameters and the canopy layer dissociation factor were recognized to have marginal influence on the output radiance. It is also found that a large portion of uncertainty in the output radiance is driven by the interaction effects among input parameters in the visible (\textasciitilde 550nm), whereas the red-near infrared (\textasciitilde 670nm), seems to have fewer interaction effects. The effect of solar/view direction is found to be significant on TOA radiance sensitivity to the input parameters. The results also confirmed that the sensitivities of surface reflectance are comparable to the TOA radiance sensitivities when the atmosphere is clear and visibility is high. Since coupled surface-atmosphere RT models can be computationally intensive, this work also introduces an improvement to the design and sampling of screening methods for efficient sensitivity analysis of computationally expensive models. The improvement is based on three elements: a) generating sample points by Sobol's sequence generator; b) variational analysis in the parameter space using the winding stairs method; c) use of mean and variance sensitivity measures. The results with 1200 model runs demonstrated high correlation (92\%) with variance-based global sensitivity analysis using 49,152 model runs, in determining the most influential and non-influential parameters.},

However, engineering design training is not widely accessible to the global community, particularly to people experiencing the challenges that the SDGs are striving to address. Purpose: This manuscript describes the Ignite program created by the Center for Global Women's Health Technologies (GWHT) at Duke University, which uses the human-centered design framework to apply engineering design concepts to address specific challenges associated with the SDGs. Design/Method: Undergraduate students participate in a design course (BME 290) to learn how to create and deliver a technological solution to increase access to light at night, which is a significant challenge in many communities around the globe. A subset of the undergraduate students partnered with an energy-poor community in which they implemented a curriculum based on the skills learned in BME 290. Results: Since 2014, 110 Duke students have taken BME 290, and 22 of those students traveled internationally, collectively teaching 275 students in Kenya, India, and Guatemala. Students in Kenya formed an engineering club and taught the curriculum to an additional 52 peers. Duke students also trained 15 other university students, both in the United States and Guatemala, who have taught the curriculum to an additional 150 students in Guatemala, which illustrates the scalability and sustainability of the curriculum across countries, communities, and cultures. Conclusions: By integrating human-centered design and the SDGs into engineering curricula and targeting communities that work with women and girls, we believe the Ignite program can impact three of the SDGs -- renewable energy, quality education, and gender equality.},

The paper is concerned with three intellectual traditions that have purported to explain the reasons for the problem, and to provide guidance for helping with the lot of the ghetto. One of these traditions views the problems in terms of inadequate policy machinery, and the resolution in terms of better analysis feeding into the policymaking process. A second views the problem in terms of organizational structure, and searches for a solution in terms of institutional reform or redesign. Still a third tradition sees the problem as stemming from the past allocation of scientific and technical talent, and proposes a solution in terms of a significant reallocation of research and development activity. It is apparent that these traditions of analysis, neither separately nor together, have been very successful in resolving social problems. The purpose of the essay is, through examination of the intellectual traditions and their interaction with the policymaking process, to try to illuminate the nature of their weaknesses and, if possible, to see what lessons can be learned regarding how to make analysis more useful, and map out some potentially fruitful directions for intellectual exploration.},

Should forecasters have been able to do a better job of predicting the slowdown in demand growth since the early 1970s? Should they have responded more quickly as actual demand growth fell short of projections? Our objective in this article is to provide some partial answers to these questions by comparing the published NERC Summary Forecasts (NSF) with benchmark forecasts provided by simple models representing well-established techniques. One alternative forecast is provided by the exponential smoothing/Box-Jenkins method (ES/BJ) and another by a simple dynamic demand equation that uses real price and real income as explanatory variables. We conclude that relative to ES/BJ, the NSF were not excessively optimistic. Relative to the simple demand equation, the early NSF were optimistic; sensitivity analysis indicates that the optimism is consistent with learning about either the permanence of higher energy prices in the mid-1970s or the full extent of demand's sensitivity to price.},

Based on common standards such as the Urban Development Plans, some projects for transportation systems renewal are progressively launched. In order to allow social cohesion, especially by providing travelers with services which may allow to better organize the transport, it is necessary to structure the transportation system according to sustainability requirements. This paper examines an integrated approach for assessing the sustainability of the current transportation system design, based on a policy making problem, aiming at providing decision makers with a framework allowing them to choose the most eco-responsible policy amongst many alternatives. Since the sustainability indicators may conflict each other, in order to better take into account the requirements of the whole transportation system in its design phase, a system-based approach has been adopted to characterize the complex structure of these indicators. A general methodology for their elicitation is proposed, using a process-object methodology and based on surveys from recent research on sustainable transportation, along with eco-design principles, in order to take into account urban transport priorities, sustainability challenges and the analysis of the whole lifecycle of the transport infrastructure and equipment. To validate this proposal, a multi-criteria decision method, allowing subjectivity, uncertainty, incomplete judgments and group consensus is then performed, based on a case study which shows the flexibility of fuzzy analytical hierarchy process for such assessment.},

This study aims to develop a regional algorithm for estimating SMC by using Landsat 8 (L8) imagery, based on analyses of the response of soil reflectance, by corresponding L8 bands with the change of SMC from dry to saturated states, in all 103 soil samples taken in the central region of Vietnam. The L8 spectral band ratio of the near-infrared band (NIR: 850\textendash 880 nm, band 5) versus the short-wave infrared 2 band (SWIR2: 2110 to 2290 nm, band 7) shows the strongest correlation to SMC by a logarithm function (R2 = 0.73 and the root mean square error, RMSE \textasciitilde{} 12\%) demonstrating the high applicability of this band ratio for estimating SMC. The resultant maps of SMC estimated from the L8 images were acquired over the northern part of the Central Highlands of Vietnam in March 2015 and March 2016 showed an agreement with the pattern of severe droughts that occurred in the region. Further discussions on the relationship between the estimated SMC and the satellite-based retrieved drought index, the Normal Different Drought Index, from the L8 image acquired in March 2016, showed a strong correlation between these two variables within an area with less than 20\% dense vegetation (R2 = 0.78 to 0.95), and co-confirms the bad effect of drought on almost all areas of the northern part of the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Directly estimating SMC from L8 imagery provides more information for irrigation management and better drought mitigation than by using the remotely sensed drought index. Further investigations on various soil types and optical sensors (i.e., Sentinel 2A, 2B) need to be carried out, to extend and promote the applicability of the prosed algorithm, towards better serving agricultural management and drought mitigation.},

Social distancing, self-isolation and travel restrictions have lead to a reduced workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured products has decreased. In contrast, the need for medical supplies has significantly increased. The food sector is also facing increased demand due to panic-buying and stockpiling of food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world economy.},

Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online.

Up-to-date building map is necessary to guide the decision making in many fields to understand the urban dynamics such as in disaster management, population estimation, planning and many other applications. Whilst mapping and surveying work using airborne SAR have started to capture many interest among surveyors, professionals and practitioners abroad, Malaysia however is still lacking behind in term of the knowledge and the usage of this technology together with Deep Learning, Machine Learning approach especially in building extraction for topographic mapping and urban planning and development. Deep learning is a subset of the machine learning algorithm. Recently, Deep Learning has been proposed to solve traditional artificial intelligent problems. In order to develop a sustainable national geospatial infrastructure for years to come, the integration between airborne SAR and other sensors as such LIDAR is therefore essential in Malaysia and in high demand for urban planning and management.

Studies have shown how current transportation planning practices are dominated by the notion of planners as experts that produce the knowledge of future transportation needs using a series of analytical steps and computer modeling. Consequently, existing practices such as transport modeling perpetuate barriers to mobility and lack of accessibility, and therefore, there is a need to make explicit how these existing practices exclude particular population groups. Using the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metropolitan Area as a case study, this paper makes a stronger connection between the assumptions planners make regarding transportation needs and goals with everyday travel experiences of a variety of residents. This research utilizes travel diaries to provide in-depth understandings of individual's travel experiences from various neighborhoods in the DFW Region to understand how differences in mobility and accessibility affect access to places.},

After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom uses institutional analysis to explore different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the 'tragedy of the commons' argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

  abstract = {Coastal ecosystems provide habitats for a wide variety of plant and animal species. They also provide many benefits to humans in the form of transportation, subsistence, and economic opportunity. These benefits are at risk due to both anthropogenic and naturally-occurring environmental harms. Effective management of these environmental harms is important to protect the ecological balance of an ecosystem and the benefits that humans derive from them. Decision Support Systems (DSS) enabled by environmental and socioeconomic data can help inform effective management. However, data cannot always be incorporated into the decision-making workflow for a multitude of reasons from awareness, to interpretability, accessibility and cost. The research outcomes presented in this thesis address processes that (1) enable a stakeholder to set priorities for the design of a DSS and (2) utilize earth observation technologies to enable low cost data collection of parameters relevant to a stakeholder. These processes are studied through a case study on Lake Nokou\'e in Benin Republic with the stakeholder Green Keeper Africa (GKA), a social enterprise located in Benin. Lake Nokou\'e faces several challenges with sustainable water management due to an invasive plant species known as the water hyacinth, and anthropogenic pressure from population growth and lake-dependent economic activities. Earth Observation technologies are applied to demonstrate (1) a method for detection and long-term analysis of water hyacinth growth trends, (2) a method for detection of a traditional fish farming practice, (3) a method for long-term water quality sensing and (4) methods for validation of all data results. The results of this thesis show progress towards creating a multi-data stream DSS that can be used by GKA, government, and community members to engage with the Lake in a manner that preserves the lake's health while protecting the ecosystem services of the surrounding human populations.},

  abstract = {In recent years, investigative reports by human rights organizations have highlighted numerous cases of U.S. incarcerated populations being exposed to life-threatening environmental harms in the form of air pollution, toxic water quality, or extreme weather like heat and flooding. The options for attaining justice in carceral landscapes in particular can be challenging to perceive because of the relative social and legal marginalization of these populations in American society; incarcerated populations are often left out of disaster response plans and broader environmental health efforts. The Space Enabled Research Group of the MIT Media Lab has developed the Environment-Vulnerability-Decision-Technology (EVDT) modeling framework which considers the interaction between the environment, societal impact, decision-making, and technology design to support decision making for environmental health. In this presentation, the EVDT framework is applied to study exposure to extreme weather events in carceral landscapes to (1) understand how environmental injustices are brought on through the existence of prisons and (2) understand opportunities for earth observation (EO) to support environmental justice campaigns for incarcerated people. The Environment Model uses EO datasets to document environmental conditions in these landscapes such as extreme heat or flood risk. The Vulnerability Model captures the health impact of environmental conditions; the Decision Model captures different modes of activism to respond to vulnerability; and the Technology Model describes what data is currently used in advocacy efforts and how EO can support those efforts. The application of the EVDT framework provides an organized way to bring together diverse datasets that can simultaneously assess and combat injustice. This study will demonstrate the viability of EVDT as an Environmental Justice framework while pushing forward technology intervention options for this specific domain of environmental justice for incarcerated populations.},

However, EO data is not always incorporated into the workflow for decision-makers for a multitude of reasons including awareness, accessibility and collaboration models. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a collaborative model that addresses historical power imbalances between communities. This paper highlights a case study of a climate harm mitigation DSS collaboration between the Space Enabled Research Group at the MIT Media Lab and Green Keeper Africa (GKA), an enterprise located in Benin. GKA addresses the management of an invasive plant species that threatens ecosystem health and economic activities on Lake Nokou\'e. They do this through a social entrepreneurship business model that aims to advance both economic empowerment and environmental health. In demonstrating a Space Enabled-GKA collaboration model that advances GKA's business aims, this study first considers several popular service and technology design methods and offer critiques of each method in terms of their ability to address inclusivity in complex systems. These critiques lead to the selection of the Systems Architecture Framework (SAF) as the technology design method for the case study. In the remainder of the paper, the SAF is applied to the case study to demonstrate how the framework coproduces knowledge that would inform a DSS with Earth Observation data. The paper offers several practical considerations and values related to epistemology, data collection, prioritization and methodology for performing inclusive design of climate data services.},

  abstract = {Although extant studies proposed various models and frameworks for sustainable supplier selection problems, they paid limited attention to the incorporation of regional economic, social, and environmental factors simultaneously for global supply chain design due to the difficulty in reflecting various dimensions of the global business environment and their associated risks in a decision model. Existing supplier selection models also tend to focus on the formulation of a simplified supply chain structure rather than considering more realistic supply chain operations under multiple sourcing and product designs. To facilitate the complex decision-making process of global supplier selection problems, this study proposes an integrated approach that consists of two phases to effectively reflect the multi-perspectives of global supply chain design for sustainability. The first phase identifies sustainable supplier regions through multi-attribute utility theory, considering four regional sustainability indices for economic and social factors in global business and logistics, to reflect the decision maker's risk attitudes on global business opportunities. In the second phase, a multi-objective integer linear programming model for multiple sourcing and multiple product designs that minimizes economic and environmental objectives is applied to find optimal suppliers and their order quantities in the regions selected from the first phase. The proposed approach is illustrated through a bicycle supplier selection case study. The results show that the multi-objective sustainable decision under a multiple sourcing strategy for different product designs leads to a supply chain that is significantly different from the single-objective non-sustainable decisions. The case study under different decision scenarios shows that a decision maker should hold a balanced perspective under the multi-objective decision environment for sustainable supply chain design.},

Here, convergence research is defined as an approach to knowledge production and action that involves diverse teams working together in novel ways \textendash{} transcending disciplinary and organizational boundaries \textendash{} to address vexing social, economic, environmental, and technical challenges in an effort to reduce disaster losses and promote collective well-being. The increasing frequency and intensity of disasters coupled with the growth of the field suggests an urgent need for a more coherent approach to help guide what we study, who we study, how we conduct studies, and who is involved in the research process itself. This article is written through the lens of the activities of the National Science Foundation-supported CONVERGE facility, which was established in 2018 as the first social science-led component of the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI). Convergence principles and the Science of Team Science undergird the work of CONVERGE, which brings together networks of researchers from geotechnical engineering, the social sciences, structural engineering, nearshore systems, operations and systems engineering, sustainable material management, and interdisciplinary science and engineering. CONVERGE supports and advances research that is conceptually integrative, and this article describes a convergence framework that includes the following elements: (1) identifying researchers; (2) educating and training researchers; (3) setting a convergence research agenda that is problem-focused and solutions-based; (4) connecting researchers and coordinating functionally and demographically diverse research teams; and (5) supporting and funding convergence research, data collection, data sharing, and solutions implementation.},

The purpose of this paper is to review system dynamics applications in the simulation of sustainable urban development over a period from 2005 to 2017. Design/methodology/approach The analysis reveals that the number of applications of system dynamics modelling in the area of urban sustainable development increased in the analysed period. Research has changed its focus from the modelling of environmental problems to more complex models, portraying the multidimensional socio-economic processes that have an impact on the sustainability of urban development. Analysed case studies most often use the behaviour reproduction test for model validation, but without a unified approach. In most cases, modelling has been done in China, Germany and the USA, while urban development in the Eastern European countries, Africa and Latin America has not often been investigated. This paper indicates the knowledge gaps and suggests future research directions. Findings Papers that report the use of system dynamics modelling reveal a wide range of applications in urban sustainability. The analysis shows significant emphasis on environmental problems, while the interest for modelling social problems has been increasing during the last several years. Most of the modelled problems examine the sustainability of resources (land, water) and waste management, which are used for insights into the reasons for the system behaviour, forecasting future behaviour and policy testing. Originality/value The presented models were developed in most cases for the purpose of understanding the phenomena examined, as well as the future use of the models in policy planning. This brings us back to the need for greater stakeholder involvement, not only in the initial phase, but also during the whole modelling process, which could increase understanding, use and ownership of the models in the future, and thus increase their practical application.},

  abstract = {Building evacuation simulation provides designers with an efficient way of testing the safety of a building before construction. A significant number of models have been developed in a variety of disciplines (computer graphics, robotics, evacuation dynamics, etc.). This paper presents a review of crowd simulation models and selected commercial software tools for high rise building evacuation simulation. The commercial tools selected (STEPS and EXODUS) are grid-based simulations, which allow for efficient implementation but introduce artifacts in the final results. This paper focuses on describing the main challenges and limitation of these tools, in addition to explaining the importance of incorporating human psychological and physiological factors into the models. The paper concludes with an overview of fundamentals that should be applied to simulate human movement closer to real movements of people, where interaction between bodies emerges and flow rates, densities, and speeds become the result of those interactions instead of some predefined value.}

The objective of the research is to improve the ability of systems engineers to anticipate and manage the effects of changing requirements. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a model for quantifying the impact of requirements volatility on systems engineering effort that can be incorporated into the Constructive Systems Engineering Cost Model. Based on a review of the literature and expert judgment collected through surveys in five workshops, we identify five observations that summarize the key considerations of requirements volatility. First, a set of project organizational, technical, and contextual factors were ranked by subject matter experts in terms of their influence on requirements volatility. Their responses point to poor initial understanding of the system and customer needs as the leading cause of requirements volatility. Second, our results suggest that, while volatility tends to decrease over time, the number of requirements changes may increase during transitions between life cycle phases. Third, requirements volatility increases the functional size of the project and causes rework of engineering products, driving an increase in systems engineering effort. Fourth, the effect of requirements volatility on systems engineering effort increases the later the change occurs in the system life cycle. Fifth, the effort impact of a requirements change varies depending on the type of change (added, deleted, and modified).},

  abstract = {Conservation tools have historically been oriented toward optimization for singular decision-makers. A new generation of participatory tools is now appearing and have begun to recognize multiple human values and decision-makers. However, very few tools accommodate a fully interactive process that can account for both ecological and social dynamism and complexity. The Collaborative Habitat Investment Atlas (CHIA) is a participatory tool for conservation prioritization with a strong visual and dynamic capability. The CHIA promotes interaction among stakeholders through two aspects: stakeholders' ability to alter variable weights to reflect different biodiversity protection requirements; and formula-based dynamic attributes that immediately update results visually. This paper documents the development of the CHIA within its role as a part of an overall adaptive community-based natural resource management pilot project in Australia's globally significant humid tropical forests. There are two primary innovations of this approach. The first innovation is the dynamic updating of values and other data, allowing rapid feedback on ``what-if?'' type questions and enhances the public engagement processes. The second innovation is the recognition and spatial description of different levels of protection across the landscape. Results include parcel-based maps that display the three models: biodiversity importance, level of protection and threat. Additionally, the three models were combined and two examples of suitability maps to aid conservation decision-making are included. When integrated into a conservation planning process the CHIA opens lines of communication, allows exploration of alternatives and enables prioritization of investment that captures the diversity of stakeholder preferences in multiple social decision making contexts.},

The ability to predict ecological responses has often been hampered by our rather limited understanding of trophic interactions. Indeed, it has proven difficult to discern direct and indirect effects of environmental change on animal populations owing to limited information about vegetation at large temporal and spatial scales. The rapidly increasing use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecological studies has recently changed this situation. Here, we review the use of the NDVI in recent ecological studies and outline its possible key role in future research of environmental change in an ecosystem context.},

  abstract = {Complex international partnerships have emerged as a policy instrument of choice for many governments to build domestic capacity in science, technology and innovation with the help of foreign partners. At present, these flagship initiatives tend to be primarily practitioner-driven with limited systematic understanding of available design options and trade-offs. Here, we present an analysis of four such partnerships from the university sector between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and governments in the UK, Portugal, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore. Using a system architecture approach in conjunctions with in-depth case studies and elements of interpretive policy analysis, we map how in each country distinct capacity-building goals, activities, and political and institutional contexts translate into different partnership architectures: a bilateral hub-\&-spokes architecture (UK), a consortium architecture (Portugal), an institution-building architecture (Abu Dhabi), and a functional expansion architecture (Singapore). Despite these differences in emergent macro-architectures, we show that each partnership draws on an identical, limited set of 'forms' that can by organized around four architectural views (education, research, innovation \& entrepreneurship, institution-building) and four levels of interaction between partners (people, programs/projects, objects, organization/process). Based on our analysis, we derive a design matrix that can help guide the development future partnerships through a systematic understanding of available design choices. Our research underscores the utility and flexibility of complex international partnerships as systemic policy instruments. It suggests a greater role for global research universities in capacity-building and international development, and emphasizes the potential of targeted cross-border funding. Our research also demonstrates the analytic power of system architecture for policy analysis and design. We argue that architectural thinking provides a useful stepping stone for STS-type interpretive policy analysis into national innovation initiatives in different political cultures, as well as more custom-tailored approaches to program evaluation.},

An alternative perspective is proposed in which animals are regarded as a marginal `social' group discursively constituted and practically affected by human communities, and as a group which is thereby subjected to all manner of sociospatial inclusions and exclusions, The argument is that animals should be seen as enmeshed in complex power relations with human communities, and in the process enduring geographies which are imposed upon them `from without' but which they may also inadvertently influence `from within'. The implications of adopting such a perspective require careful examination, but in the second part of this paper some possibilities are raised though substantive vignettes of animals as a social group included in or excluded from the city. Particular attention is paid to 19th-century debates about meat markets and slaughterhouses, wherein can be detected a will to exclude livestock animals from cities such as London and Chicago on a variety of grounds (medical and hygienic, organisational and moral).},

This paper considers some of the difficulties in establishing verification and validation of agent based models, and proposes the use of coloured petri net formalism to specify agent behaviour in order to check if the model looks logical and the model behaves logical. Model plausibility is used to express the conformity of the model with a priori knowledge about the process. The proposed methodology has been applied in the European Future Policy Modelling project (www.fupol.eu) to create trust and increase the credibility of the agent based models developed to foster e-participation in the design of urban policies by means of simulation techniques.},

  abstract = {Maps are changing. They have become important and fashionable once more. Rethinking Maps brings together leading researchers to explore how maps are being rethought, made and used, and what these changes mean for working cartographers, applied mapping research, and cartographic scholarship. It offers a contemporary assessment of the diverse forms that mapping now takes and, drawing upon a number of theoretic perspectives and disciplines, provides an insightful commentary on new ontological and epistemological thinking with respect to cartography.  This book presents a diverse set of approaches to a wide range of map forms and activities in what is presently a rapidly changing field. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach to important contemporary mapping practices, with chapters written by leading theorists who have an international reputation for innovative thinking. Much of the new research around mapping is emerging as critical dialogue between practice and theory and this book has chapters focused on intersections with play, race and cinema. Other chapters discuss cartographic representation, sustainable mapping and visual geographies. It also considers how alternative models of map creation and use such as open-source mappings and map mash-up are being creatively explored by programmers, artists and activists. There is also an examination of the work of various `everyday mappers' in diverse social and cultural contexts.   This blend of conceptual chapters and theoretically directed case studies provides an excellent resource suited to a broad spectrum of researchers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in human geography, GIScience and cartography, visual anthropology, media studies, graphic design and computer graphics. Rethinking Maps is a necessary and significant text for all those studying or having an interest in cartography.},

  abstract = {The climate emergency and population growth are challenging water security and sustainable urban design in cities worldwide. Sustainable urban development is crucial to minimise pressures on the natural environment and on existing urban infrastructure systems, including water, energy, and land. These pressures are particularly evident in London, which is considered highly vulnerable to water shortages and floods and where there has been a historical shortage of housing. However, the impacts of urban growth on environmental management and protection are complex and difficult to evaluate. In addition, there is a disconnection between the policy and decision-making processes as to what comprises a sustainable urban development project. We present a systems-based Urban Planning Sustainability Framework (UPSUF) that integrates sustainability evaluation, design solutions and planning system process. One of the features of this master planning framework is the spatial representation of the urban development in a Geographical Information System to create an operational link between design solutions and evaluation metrics. UPSUF moves from an initial baseline scenario to a sustainable urban development design, incorporating the requirements of governance and regulatory bodies, as well as those of the end-users. Ultimately, UPSUF has the potential to facilitate partnership between the public and the private sectors.},

Having comprehensively reviewed the application of thermodynamic entropy to urban systems we argue that the role it can hope to play in characterising sustainability is less general than has been suggested in the past. We show that thermodynamic entropy may be considered as a measure of energy efficiency, but must be complimented by other indices to form part of a broader measure of urban sustainability.},

However, further development has been impeded by the shortage of land space, especially for the construction of warehouses. This paper proposes the concept of Supply Hub in Industrial Park (SHIP) as a promising approach addressing this challenge. SHIP is defined as a public provider of warehousing and logistics services for manufacturing enterprises located within an industrial park. The research reported in this paper focuses on evaluating the value of freight consolidation, one of the typical benefits of applying the SHIP approach. Two mathematical models of the supply chain in a typical industrial park are formulated: with and without SHIP. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied for solving the two models, and sensitivity experiments are conducted for comparative analysis between the two scenarios. The computational results show that through consolidating shipments, SHIP brings benefits to the whole industrial park. Total cost savings resulted from the application of SHIP would increase with the size of the supply chain, the vehicle capacity, and the rates of fixed transportation costs and holding costs of finished products at manufacturers.},

  abstract = {The proliferation in the number of mobile devices and developments in cellular technology has led to an ever increasing demand for mobile data. The global bandwidth shortage facing wireless carriers today has motivated research for fifth generation (5G) cellular systems. In recent years, millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz are being considered as a promising technology for 5G systems. Such systems can offer superior user experience by providing data rates that exceed one Gigabit per second and latencies lower than a millisecond. However, there is little research about cellular mmW propagation in densely populated urban environments. Understanding the radio channel is a primary requirement for optimal design of mmW systems. Radio propagation in mmW systems faces significant challenges due to rapidly varying channel conditions and intermittent connectivity. In this paper, we study the propagation of mmW spectrum in an urban environment. We use a statistical model to simulate an urban environment with diverse building distributions. We perform extensive simulations to analyze the path loss behavior for both line of sight (LOS) and non line of sight (NLOS) conditions for 28 GHZ and 73 GHZ mmW frequencies. We observe that the path loss approximates a logarithmic fit for both LOS and NLOS environments. Our simulations show that the omnidirectional free space path loss is approximately 30 dB higher for mmW systems compared to current 3G PP cellular systems. To address this challenge, we propose using highly directional horn antennas with beam forming for reducing the path loss.},

  abstract = {The majority of restoration strategies in the wake of large-scale disasters have focused on short-term emergency response solutions. Few consider medium- to long-term restoration strategies to reconnect urban areas to national supply chain interdependent critical infrastructure systems (SCICI). These SCICI promote the effective flow of goods, services, and information vital to the economic vitality of an urban environment. To re-establish the connectivity that has been broken during a disaster between the different SCICI, relationships between these systems must be identified, formulated, and added to a common framework to form a system-level restoration plan. To accomplish this goal, a considerable collection of SCICI data is necessary. The aim of this paper is to review what data are required for model construction, the accessibility of these data, and their integration with each other. While a review of publically available data reveals a dearth of real-time data to assist modeling long-term recovery following an extreme event, a significant amount of static data does exist and these data can be used to model the complex interdependencies needed. For the sake of illustration, a particular SCICI (transportation) is used to highlight the challenges of determining the interdependencies and creating models capable of describing the complexity of an urban environment with the data publically available. Integration of such data as is derived from public domain sources is readily achieved in a geospatial environment, after all geospatial infrastructure data are the most abundant data source and while significant quantities of data can be acquired through public sources, a significant effort is still required to gather, develop, and integrate these data from multiple sources to build a complete model. Therefore, while continued availability of high quality, public information is essential for modeling efforts in academic as well as government communities, a more streamlined approach to a real-time acquisition and integration of these data is essential.},

This data structure is challenging due to its characteristics and the limitation of the acquisition step which adds a considerable amount of noise. Therefore, enhancing 3D point clouds is a very crucial and critical step. In this paper, we investigate two promising unsupervised techniques which are One-Class SVM (OCSVM) and Isolation Forest (IF). These two techniques optimize the separation between relevant/normal points and irrelevant/noisy points. For evaluation, three metrics are computed, which are the processing time, the number of detected noisy points, and Peak Signal-to-Noise (PSNR) in order to compare the both proposed techniques with one of the recommended filters in the literature which is Moving Least Square (MLS) filter. The obtained results reveal promising capability in terms of effectiveness. However, OCSVM technique suffers from high computational time; therefore, its efficiency is enhanced using modern Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) with an average rate improvement of 1.8.},

  abstract = {The city of Rio de Janeiro, with more than 5 million inhabitants, has two big mountains in its centre with natural Atlantic rain forest. The growth of the city around these two mountains puts pressure on this forest. This endangers the remaining Atlantic forest (one of the most endangered forest types of the world) and also causes landslides and mud flows. The city administration carried out a land-cover forest classification with visual interpretation using merged LANDSAT and SPOT data. This work produced a compatible thematic map in the scale 1:50,000. It took about 36 months of intensive work and high costs to produce these maps. The scale of these maps permit to have a global vision of the land change cover but unfortunately do not correspond with the geographic information system of the city, which works with a scale of 1:10,000. The city searched for options to make this work automatically and quickly to get information for planning and to propose solutions. In order to solve this problem high resolution satellite data and automatic classification of land-cover classes are needed. Consequently, images as IKONOS (multispectral with four bands and 4 meters) need to be used to produce a classification, with a scale corresponding to the GIS of the city. The automatic classification of land-cover classes provides a relatively rapid classification. Pixel based classification with high resolution data show some problems because the level of information in the data produce a lot of incorrect classified pixels. The solution to perform this classification uses the new approach that makes one "pre-classification" (classification), which transforms the pixel information in objects as well as the feature in the vector representation.},

  abstract = {There are benefits to be gained from combining the strengths of modeling frameworks that capture social, environmental and design-based considerations. Many of the important challenges of the next decade lie at the intersection of the natural environment, human decision making and the design of space technology to inform decision making. There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals outlined by the United Nations through 2030. Several of these Sustainable Development Goals can be addressed by asking: 1) What is happening in the natural environment? 2) How will humans be impacted by what is happening in the natural environment? 3) What decisions are humans making in response to environmental factors and why? and 4) What technology system can be designed to provide high quality information that supports human decision making? The answers to these questions are often interrelated in complex ways; thus it is helpful to use a framework from complex systems to integrate these questions. Within the list of Sustainable Development Goals, several fit the three questions above, including \#2 Zero Hunger, \#6 Clean Water and Sanitation, \#13 Climate Action, \#14 Life Below Water, and \#15 Life on Land. This paper presents a research agenda to apply environmental modeling, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering to inform the design of space systems in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. This work builds on previous research in the following areas: 1) physics-based environmental modeling; 2) complex systems modeling to simulate human decision making using agent-based models; and 3) model based systems engineering to inform the architecture of satellites or space-enabled data systems. This paper presents a review of the state of the art, shows examples of how these methods have been combined to inform space system design and presents a future research agenda. As an example, the paper discusses a project related to Sustainable Development Goal \#15 to design an earth observation system using space-based and ground-based data collection regarding an invasive plant species in Benin, West Africa. In this example, insights are needed regarding natural variables (i.e. salinity, temperature and turbidity of local waterways), social variables (i.e. economic impact of the invasive plant on local communities), and design variables (i.e. the technical performance of existing imagery satellites and in-situ sensor networks).},

  abstract = {There is an increasing need for tools to translate Earth Observation (EO) data into societally rele-  vant metrics to inform human decision-making. To address this need, we present a multi-disciplinary,  interactive modeling framework to advance ecological forecasting and policymaking using EO data. This  framework will integrate four model components into one tool: Earth Science, Social Impact, Human  Behavior and Satellite Design. The capabilities provided by this framework will improve the management  of EO and socioeconomic data in a format usable by non-experts, while harnessing cloud computing,  machine learning, economic analysis, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering.  This paper presents a prototype that demonstrates the viability of the framework via a case study:  the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. These mangroves are vulnerable due to  urbanization and rising sea levels. They provide a variety of ecosystem services, including serving as  a mechanism for carbon sequestration, supporting subsistence  shing, preventing coastal erosion, and  attracting an ecotourism industry.  The case study of mangrove and community health in Rio de Janeiro demonstrates all four model  components. The Earth Science Model builds upon work by NASA biospheric scientists to use EO data,  cloud computing and machine learning to track mangrove extent, health, and vulnerability over time for a  600 km2 area, as well as work by the Espa co research group at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro  on the local mangrove ecosystem. To create the Human Decision Making model, we have partnered with  Instituto Pereira Passos (the data science o ce of the Rio de Janeiro municipal government) to understand  the policy history and socioeconomic factors. To build the Social Impact model, we are collaborating with  ecosystem services economists to explain how policies impact mangrove health and how mangroves impact  socioeconomic wellbeing. The Satellite Design Model accounts for the types of data collection used by  policy makers since 1985.  Through such collaborations, we are able to build an integrated, interactive model that policymakers  can use to assess mangrove health, ecosystem services value, and policy consequences. The model helps  answer such questions as: (a) What is the state of the mangroves over time? (b) How are human  communities impacting the mangroves? (c) what is the value of the mangrove ecosystem services to  human communities? and (d) what policies can improve human and mangrove outcomes? This case  study is demonstrative of the viability of a similar approach for ecosystems around the world.},

  abstract = {The Vida Decision Support System (Vida) is an application of the Environment-Vulnerability-  Decision-Technology (EVDT) integrated modeling framework specifically aimed at COVID-19 impact  and response analysis. The development of Vida has been an international collaboration involving  multidisciplinary teams of academics, government officials (including public health, economics,  environmental, and demographic data collection officials), and others from six states: Angola, Brazil,  Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, and the United States. These collaborators have been involved with  the identification of decision support needs, the surfacing and creation of relevant data products,  and the evaluation of prototypes, with the vision of creating an openly available online platform  that integrates earth observation instruments (Landsat, VIIRs, Planet Lab's PlanetScope, NASA's  Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center, etc.) with in-situ data sources (COVID-19 case data,  local demographic data, policy histories, mobile device-based mobility indices, etc.). Vida both  visualizes historical data of relevance to decision-makers and simulates possible future scenarios.  The modeling techniques used include system dynamics for public health, EO-based change detection  and machine learning for environmental analysis, and discrete-event simulation of policy changes and  impacts. In addition to the direct object of this collaboration (the development of Vida), collaborators  have also benefited from sharing individual COVID-19-related insights with the network and from  considering COVID-19 response in a more integrated fashion. This work outlines the Vida Decision  Support System concept and the EVDT framework on which it is based. The international team is  using Vida to evaluate the outcomes in several large cities regarding COVID cases, environmental  changes, economic changes and policy decisions. It provides an overview of the overlapping and  diverging needs and data sources of each of the collaborating teams, as well as how each of those  teams have contributed to the development of Vida. The current state of the Vida prototypes and plans  for future development will be presented. Additionally, this work will discuss the lessons learned  from this development process and their relevance to other integrated applications.},

Among the criteria incorporated by the model are the minimization of city-wide travel time, the equalization of average regional travel times, and the equalization of company workloads. A comparison of the allocations generated by the model with the actual allocation of fire companies in New York City shows that, for one value of the trade-off parameter, the model produces results that correspond closely to the New York City Fire Department's allocation policy.},

The assessment was based on direct observations and nine interviews: three of them with regulator of emergencies medical doctor, three with radio operators and three with telephone attendants. The results indicated that, to a great extent, the core characteristics of complexity are magnified) due to basic shortcomings in the design of the work system. Thus, some recommendations are put forward with a view to reducing unnecessary complexity that hinders the performance of the socio-technical system.},

The retrieval algorithm, developed and implemented for routine global processing at NASA's Land Science Investigator-led Processing System (SIPS), utilizes all high-quality, cloud-free, atmospheric-, terrain-, vegetation-, snow-, lunar-, and stray light-corrected radiances to estimate daily nighttime lights (NTL) and other intrinsic surface optical properties. Key algorithm enhancements include: (1) lunar irradiance modeling to resolve non-linear changes in phase and libration; (2) vector radiative transfer and lunar bidirectional surface anisotropic reflectance modeling to correct for atmospheric and BRDF effects; (3) geometric-optical and canopy radiative transfer modeling to account for seasonal variations in NTL; and (4) temporal gap-filling to reduce persistent data gaps. Extensive benchmark tests at representative spatial and temporal scales were conducted on the VNP46 time series record to characterize the uncertainties stemming from upstream data sources. Initial validation results are presented together with example case studies illustrating the scientific utility of the products. This includes an evaluation of temporal patterns of NTL dynamics associated with urbanization, socioeconomic variability, cultural characteristics, and displaced populations affected by conflict. Current and planned activities under the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Human Planet Initiative are aimed at evaluating the products at different geographic locations and time periods representing the full range of retrieval conditions.},

  abstract = {Over the past five years, researchers working on a number of system design projects in the Space Systems, Policy, and Architecture Research Consortium (SSPARC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a process of value-focused, broad tradespace exploration for the development of space systems. The broad tradespace framework has provided insights into communicating and quantifying the impact of changing requirements, uncertainty, and system properties such as flexibility and robustness. Additionally, insights have been made in applications to more complex cases, such as analyzing policy effects on system cost and performance, as well as understanding the time-dependent effects of architecture and design choices for spiral development. The tradespace exploration paradigm both broadens the perspective of designers in conceptual design to better understand the ``physics'' of the proposed solutions relative to one another, and focuses the designer on delivering systems of value to key system stakeholders.},

  abstract = {A traditional approach to system design is to optimize the system with regard to a set of system objectives, as defined in a given context. This approach falls short when designing systems that are capable of delivering sustained value to stakeholders in the face of a rapidly changing world. In order to achieve this value robustness, systems should be designed using natural value-centric time scales, as defined by their contexts, for conceptualizing system timelines. Epoch-Era Analysis is an approach that provides for visualization and a structured way to think about the temporal system value environment. This paper discusses Epoch-Era Analysis as central to a tradespace exploration process for system design comparison and selection, invoking passive or active value robustness design strategies. The analysis can also serve as a socio-technical bridge, integrating the tradespace exploration activities of architects and engineers, which may be traditionally independent efforts in contemporary engineering programs.},

Identical particles hop from site to site on a regular lattice, obeying simple conservative scattering rules when they collide. Remarkably, at a scale larger than the lattice spacing, these discrete models simulate the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid mechanics. This book addresses three important aspects of lattice gases. First, it shows how such simple idealised microscopic dynamics give rise to isotropic macroscopic hydrodynamics. Second, it details how the simplicity of the lattice gas provides for equally simple models of fluid phase separation, hydrodynamic interfaces, and multiphase flow. Lastly, it illustrates how lattice-gas models and related lattice-Boltzmann methods have been used to solve problems in applications as diverse as flow through porous media, phase separation, and interface dynamics. Many exercises and references are included.},

  abstract = {At over 40years, the Landsat satellites provide the longest temporal record of space-based land surface observations, and the successful 2013 launch of the Landsat-8 is continuing this legacy. Ideally, the Landsat data record should be consistent over the Landsat sensor series. The Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has improved calibration, signal to noise characteristics, higher 12-bit radiometric resolution, and spectrally narrower wavebands than the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+). Reflective wavelength differences between the two Landsat sensors depend also on the surface reflectance and atmospheric state which are difficult to model comprehensively. The orbit and sensing geometries of the Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-7 ETM+ provide swath edge overlapping paths sensed only one day apart. The overlap regions are sensed in alternating backscatter and forward scattering orientations so Landsat bi-directional reflectance effects are evident but approximately balanced between the two sensors when large amounts of time series data are considered. Taking advantage of this configuration a total of 59 million 30m corresponding sensor observations extracted from 6317 Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI images acquired over three winter and three summer months for all the conterminous United States (CONUS) are compared. Results considering different stages of cloud and saturation filtering, and filtering to reduce one day surface state differences, demonstrate the importance of appropriate per-pixel data screening. Top of atmosphere (TOA) and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are compared and their differences quantified. On average the OLI TOA reflectance is greater than the ETM+ TOA reflectance for all bands, with greatest differences in the near-infrared (NIR) and the shortwave infrared bands due to the quite different spectral response functions between the sensors. The atmospheric correction reduces the mean difference in the NIR and shortwave infrared but increases the mean difference in the visible bands. Regardless of whether TOA or surface reflectance are used to generate NDVI, on average, for vegetated soil and vegetation surfaces (0{$\leq$}NDVI{$\leq$}1), the OLI NDVI is greater than the ETM+ NDVI. Statistical functions to transform between the comparable sensor bands and sensor NDVI values are presented so that the user community may apply them in their own research to improve temporal continuity between the Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI sensor data. The transformation functions were developed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and were fit quite reliably (r2 values{$>$}0.7 for the reflectance data and {$>$}0.9 for the NDVI data, p-values{$<$}0.0001).},

Sachs offers readers, students, activists, environmentalists, and policy makers the tools, metrics, and practical pathways they need to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Far more than a rhetorical exercise, this book is designed to inform, inspire, and spur action. Based on Sachs's twelve years as director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, his thirteen years advising the United Nations secretary-general on the Millennium Development Goals, and his recent presentation of these ideas in a popular online course, The Age of Sustainable Development is a landmark publication and clarion call for all who care about our planet and global justice.

The characterization of vulnerability is traditionally accomplished using nationwide census exercises, a burdensome process that requires field visits by trained personnel. Unfortunately, most countrywide censuses exercises are conducted only sporadically, making it difficult to track the short-term effect of policies to reduce poverty. This paper introduces a definition of vulnerability following UN-Habitat criteria, assesses different CNN machine learning architectures, and establishes a mapping between satellite images and survey data. Starting with the information corresponding to the 2,178,508 residential blocks recorded in the 2010 Mexican census and multispectral Landsat-7 images, multiple CNN architectures are explored. The best performance is obtained with EfficientNet-B3 achieving an area under the ROC and Precision-Recall curves of 0.9421 and 0.9457, respectively. This article shows that publicly available information, in the form of census data and satellite images, along with standard CNN architectures, may be employed as a stepping stone for the countrywide characterization of vulnerability at the residential block level.},

We include several regressions with the objective of addressing outliers in the data as well as the possible correlations between observations of the same study. We also investigate possible interaction effects between type of service and GDP per capita. Our findings indicate that mangroves exhibit decreasing returns to scale, that GDP per capita has a positive effect on mangrove values and that using the replacement cost and contingent valuation methods produce higher estimates than do other methods. We also find that there are statistically significant interaction effects that influence the data. Finally, the results indicate that employing weighted regressions provide a better fit than others. However, in terms of forecast performance we find that all the estimated models performed similarly and were not able to conclude decisively that one outperforms the other.},

In fact, a number of authors have put forth development lifecycle models that are subsets of the classical systems engineering method, but fail to include steps such as incremental hazard analysis and post-deployment corrective and preventative actions. In that most health information systems have safety implications, we argue that the design and development of such systems would benefit by implementing this systems engineering approach in full. Particularly with regard to bringing a human-centered perspective to the formulation of system requirements and the configuration of effective user interfaces, this classical systems engineering method provides an excellent framework for incorporating human factors (ergonomics) knowledge and integrating ergonomists in the interdisciplinary development of health information systems.},

The article seeks to demonstrate how mega-events are being instrumentalized by local political and economic elites, especially by a coalition of ambitious civic leaders, private entrepreneurs, and local real estate interests, who exploit the event-related sense of urgency, mobilization, and consensus in order to remake the city in their own image. Through the study of a series of projects conceived with the mega-events deadline in mind, and with a special emphasis on Porto Maravilha's port revitalization project, the article shows how such an event-led planning model fosters an exclusive vision of urban regeneration. It sustains that such vision can open the way for the state-assisted privatization and commodification of the urban realm, and promote the rise of a new, 'exceptional' form of neo-liberal urban regeneration in the Latin American landscape, which serves the needs of capital while exacerbating socio-spatial segregation, inequality and social conflicts. \textcopyright{} 2013 \textcopyright{} Taylor \& Francis.},

Mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil. In order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical. Current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects. To close this knowledge gap, we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machine-learning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution. This model, which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global SoilGrids 250 m model, was able to capture 63\% of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density (RMSE of 10.9 kg m-3). Of the local variables, total suspended sediment load and Landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density. Projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 6.4 Pg C for the top meter of soil with an 86\textendash 729 Mg C ha-1 range across all pixels. By utilizing remotely-sensed mangrove forest cover change data, loss of soil carbon due to mangrove habitat loss between 2000 and 2015 was 30\textendash 122 Tg C with {$>$}75\% of this loss attributable to Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The resulting map products from this work are intended to serve nations seeking to include mangrove habitats in payment-for- ecosystem services projects and in designing effective mangrove conservation strategies.},

  abstract = {Historically there have been very few attempts to build neighborhood-level indicators as a means of measuring neighborhood problems and designing policies to address them. However, recent developments in desktop geographic information systems, combined with the devolution of social programs to the local level, have created the technology and the need for such indicators. In the history of indicator use, five lessons for neighborhood indicators stand out. First, it is imperative that the numbers have a specific policy purpose. Second, geographic indicators play a special role, more important than that of subject area indicators, because policy is administered through geographic units and because neighborhoods and cities themselves affect the quality of people's lives. Third, one must from the outset distinguish clearly between indicators that measure neighborhood well-being and indicators that measure the well-being of neighborhood residents. Fourth, to be most useful, indicators must be unbundled, that is, not tied to an overall index. Finally, the movement to use geographic indicators, especially on the neighborhood scale, is in its infancy. Neighborhood-level indicators are just beginning to be used to make and evaluate policy, and to search for the causes of change in neighborhoods and in the lives of their residents.},

  abstract = {Despite being a vital part of the urban mobility system, the taxi receives little attention from planners and policy makers; thus, its potential contributions to enhance sustainable mobility are often overlooked. Consequently, this paper adopts an innovative perspective to rethink the taxi for enhancing sustainable urban mobility. It takes a closer look at the prospects of urban taxi fleets for supporting the transition of a city's mobility system towards sustainability. The work is attributed to the project~``Future Urban Taxi''~under the initiative~``Ambient Mobility Lab''~supported with funding from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Labor and Housing of the federal state Baden-W\"urttemberg in Germany. To relate to a specific urban context, ten German cities were previously analyzed and Hamburg chosen as a use case. The city provides good availability of both taxi and mobility data, and the municipality is comparatively open to innovative concepts (e.g., the voluntary introduction of the fiscal taximeter, allowing more flexible pricing). By analyzing the use case Hamburg,~``Future Urban Taxi''~focuses on two main challenges: (i) how the taxi as a vehicle has to adapt to user demand and specific urban contexts, and (ii) how the taxi as a system can be integrated into the mobility system of a city in a more effective and sustainable way. A qualitative methodology consisting of the collection and qualitative assessment of expert interviews, as well as a scenario and gap analysis, was used to assess the potential of various taxi concepts. Three future scenarios for the year 2025 were built around them to arrive at three taxi concepts\textemdash the electric taxi, autonomous taxi and shared taxis. Each of these can contribute to the sustainability of Hamburg's urban mobility system in varying degrees. The highest contribution lies in the implementation of shared-taxi services. They are rather easy to implement and can achieve quick benefits both for the customers and taxi operators. The electrification of taxis is rated second, since it requires investments in infrastructure and new forms of operations of the vehicles. The autonomous-taxi concept is least likely to be implemented soon, even though it could offer quite a few benefits. The reason is that there are~still a lot of uncertainties (technical, spatial, legal) regarding this technology. By highlighting the need to rethink the taxi, this paper offers an insightful understanding of this mobility service in the specific urban system of the case study city of Hamburg.},

The VIIRS instrument carries two separate sets of multi-spectral channels providing full global coverage at both 375. m and 750. m nominal resolutions every 12. h or less depending on the latitude. In this study, we introduce a new VIIRS active fire detection algorithm, which is driven primarily by the 375. m middle and thermal infrared imagery data. The algorithm builds on the well-established MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies product using a contextual approach to detect both day and nighttime biomass burning and other thermal anomalies. Here we present the fire algorithm's design and implementation, including important information describing the input data characteristics and potential artifacts associated with pixel saturation and the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly, both found to affect the middle infrared channel data. Initial assessment using results derived from the global processing of the algorithm indicated small, although variable, commission errors ({$<$} 1.2\%) for nominal confidence fire pixels. We achieved improved performance using the 375. m active fire data compared to the VIIRS 750. m baseline fire product, resulting in a 3. ?? and 25. ?? factor increase in the absolute number of fire pixels detected using day and nighttime data, respectively. Similarly, VIIRS 375. m fire data showed significantly superior mapping capabilities compared to current MODIS fire detection data with improved consistency of fire perimeter delineation for biomass burning lasting multiple days. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The release of high spatial and temporal resolution cell phone data presented a unique opportunity to study the correlation between mobility, electricity use, and tropospheric NO2. While many studies have identified trends of changes in air pollution in locations with reduced mobility due to Covid-19-related restrictions, these studies fall short of assessing whether these trends are statistically significant. Here we analyze if, and how much, mobility, nighttime light and NO2 concentrations correlate. We analyze seven geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the United States (Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, Phoenix) in the first half of 2020. Using statistical tests of significance, we find that there is a strong correlation between NO2 levels and nighttime light during February-July 2020 in all urban centers. Mobility and NO2 are correlated strongly in four of the seven urban areas investigated. Together, these results suggest that policies aimed at limiting anthropogenic emissions from fixed (power generation) and mobile (traffic) NO2 sources have an effect on air quality but additional factors should also be considered.},

In so doing, the study's findings contribute to pressing policy issues such as social exclusion. Seven counties of the Louisville, Kentucky-Indiana MSA serve as the study area for the investigation. Data are derived from three sources: a geocoded travel diary survey, a geocoded database of all opportunities in the area, and a database of shortest-path travel times. Accessibility indices (gravity, cumulative opportunity, and proximity) are defined for 34 types of opportunities: four aggregate types and 30 disaggregate types representing the 10 most popular destinations for trips for each of the first three aggregate types. These indices are computed for households that responded to the trip-diary survey. Non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests are used to compare the levels of accessibility experienced by five socio-economic groups (i.e., individuals residing in rural communities, individuals residing in single-person and single-parent households, individuals residing in low-income households, women, and the elderly) to counterpart groups. Except for individuals residing in rural areas, the findings of this study indicate that groups conventionally considered to be at risk of social exclusion are not disadvantaged in terms of accessibility.},

  author = {Selva Valero, Daniel Selva},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {System architecting is concerned with exploring the tradespace of early, high-level, system design decisions with a holistic, value-centric view. In the last few years, several tools and methods have been developed to support the system architecting process, focusing on the representation of an architecture as a set of interrelated decisions. These tools are best suited for applications that focus on breadth - i.e., enumerating a large and representative part of the architectural tradespace -as opposed to depth - modeling fidelity. However, some problems in system architecting require good modeling depth in order to provide useful results. In some cases, a very large body of expert knowledge is required. Current tools are not designed to handle such large bodies of knowledge because they lack scalability and traceability. As the size of the knowledge base increases, it becomes harder: a) to modify existing knowledge or add new knowledge; b) to trace the results of the tool to the model assumptions or knowledge base. This thesis proposes a holistic framework for architecture tradespace exploration of large complex systems that require a large body of expert knowledge. It physically separates the different bodies of knowledge required to solve a system architecting problem (i.e., knowledge about the domain, knowledge about the class of optimization or search problem, knowledge about the particular instance of problem) by using a rule-based expert system. It provides a generic population-based heuristic algorithm for search, which can be augmented with rules that encode knowledge about the domain, or about the optimization problem or class of problems. It identifies five major classes of system architecting problems from the perspective of optimization and search, and provides rules to enumerate architectures and search through the architectural tradespace of each class. A methodology is also defined to assess the value of an architecture using a rule-based approach. This methodology is based on a decomposition of stakeholder needs into requirements and a systematic comparison between system requirements and system capabilities using the rules engine. The framework is applied to the domain of Earth observing satellite systems (EOSS). Three EOSS are studied in depth: the NASA Earth Observing System, the NRC Earth Science Decadal Survey, and the Iridium GEOscan program. The ability of the framework to produce useful results is shown, and specific insights and recommendations are drawn.},

Python wrappers were developed to loosely couple land use, land cover, transportation, and emission models developed in different environments. ArcGIS Model Builder was used to provide a graphical user interface and to present the models' workflow. The suggested approach is especially efficient when the models are developed in different programming languages, their source codes are not available, or the licensing restrictions make other coupling approaches impractical.},

These types cover most of the characteristics of complexity mentioned in the reviewed literature; omissions are noted. It would be advantageous to identify specific measures of complexity so that the complexity of systems or development programs could be compared and tracked, and risks could be identified and mitigated. To this end an overview of systems engineering measurement is provided, followed by a discussion of how complexity types might be able to be measured. At this point, however, a composite measurement of the six types of complexity is not recommended.},

Awareness of complexity theory can help practicing engineers perform their tasks differently on projects, in ways ranging from understanding the problem space and making models of the environment early in the life cycle, through managing changing requirements, designing differently, and identifying and managing risks, to supporting changing project management approaches. In addition, a science of complex systems engineering is being formed.

  abstract = {It is important to understand the characteristics of swash in terms of disaster mitigation and coastal management, as it has great impacts on coastal structures, beach processes and coastal zone management. Although many studies focused on the temporal variation of the swash motion as the importance of infra-gravity waves is recognized, the spatial characteristics remain unknown probably because of difficulty in the observation. In this study, the swash motion on 2.87 km sandy beach in Miyazaki, Japan was captured in videos by three synchronized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs were situated in 850 m interval, shooting bird's-eye video. The videos were synchronized and projected orthographically to detect the edges of the swash using the luminance difference. Spatiotemporal profile of swash on the beach was obtained for 2.87 km and 823 s. With spectral analysis, longer periods of run-up fluctuation (14 s, 25 s and 43 s) were observed, whereas the predominant swell period is about 10s. The intensity of those waves fluctuates in the longshore direction. The spatial fluctuation of intensity of infra-gravity waves appears to correlate with the width of surf zone, which implies a resonant interaction mechanism between the topography and infra-gravity waves within the surf zone.},

  abstract = {In city planning contexts, hypermedia systems have been demonstrated to be engaging tools that make complex information understandable to those who are not technically sophisticated. This is accomplished through the use of multimedia interfaces that use images, motion, and sound as representational aids. Hypermedia also affords associative linking which allows one to organize and browse related information in a manner similar to encyclopedic cross-referencing. Many of the early applications of these systems have been hampered by computing platform dependence and an inability to form associative links with remotely accessible information. The issue of connectivity with remotely accessible information has recently been addressed through the maturation of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). This makes it possible for the globally networked community to access this information in an associative manner. In this paper I will reflect on the relevance of the WWW to multimedia-based collaborative planning systems (CPS), drawing upon two examples from the National Capital Planning Commission in Washington, DC. Some of the initial benefits and drawbacks of the distributed approach to geographic hypermedia systems will be reviewed.},

Variability in L-band HH and HV gamma-naught ({$\gamma$}0) for forests was observed between regions, with this attributed to differences in forest structure and vegetation/surface moisture conditions. Region-specific backscatter thresholds were therefore applied to produce from each annual mosaic, a global map of forest and non-forest cover from which maps of forest losses and gain were generated. The overall agreement with forest/non-forest assessments using the Degree Confluence Project, the Forest Resource Assessment and Google Earth images was 85\%, 91\% and 95\% respectively. Using 2007 as a baseline, decreases of 0.040 and 0.028dB (with a 0.006dB 99\% confidence level) were observed in the HH and HV {$\gamma$}0 respectively over the same areas suggesting a decrease in forest area and/or increased smoothing of the global surface at the L-band radar observation over the four-year period. The maps provide a new global resource for documenting the changing extent of forests and offer opportunities for quantifying historical and future dynamics through comparison with historical (1992\textendash 1998) Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) SAR and the forthcoming (from 2014) ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data.

The Landsat 8 OLI image of an interest area in Beilunhekou National Nature Reserve was used to test the spectral metrics. The derived spectral metrics and raw band reflectance data were classified using a support vector machine classifier. Mangrove forest maps were then identified from the classified images. Identification accuracies were compared and evaluated by determining the user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), overall accuracy (OA) and by conducting McNemar's test. Results showed that the use of spectral metrics (UA = 85\%, PA = 94\%, OA = 95\%) outperformed the use of raw band reflectance data (UA = 72\%, PA = 82\%, OA = 90\%). McNemar's test confirmed that the spectral metrics were significantly better than the raw band reflectance data (Z = 4.63, p {$<$} 0.05). Therefore, the proposed spectral metrics could improve the accuracy of mangrove forest identification.},

Such systems have been analyzed through the lenses of sustainability (largely along the dimensions of environmental protection and affordability), carrying influence in the literatures of technology innovation, product design, infrastructure planning, and service delivery. Sustainability concerns along the environmental and financial dimensions have motivated focus on waste and emissions reduction, new technology development, and greening of industrial ecosystems. The concept of inclusive development, however, has not yet permeated the research or conceptualization of sociotechnical systems. Two streams of on-going work in inclusive innovation and in inclusive wealth analysis offer meaningful avenues for future connections. We discuss how the literature on sociotechnical systems and their constituent elements of engineered products and processes has evolved on the topic of sustainability, how the emerging concept of inclusive innovation bridges dimensions of environment and social inclusivity, and how inclusive wealth may inform system-level planning and analysis of sociotechnical systems moving forward.}

These new types of missions are enabling earth observation with multi-angular, multi-spectral data acquisition at high resolution and high revisit frequencies. The architectural choices have grown exponentially in such distributed systems, and there is a need for quantitative measures, that go beyond cost estimation, and assess value (or scientific return) over a mission's operational life-cycle. Here, we formulate a novel metric, Net Architecture Value (NAV), that can be used in early stage conceptual mission design and architecture trade studies. We propose that useful data of adequate quality, obtained over regions of interest, acquired by a system over its lifetime can be used as a proxy measure of value. We demonstrate the application of this approach for a distributed space mission.},

Challenges of ensuring radiometric data quality and consistency of data products, however, have not been widely recognized. As new products and applications rapidly emerge, and decisions linked to public safety, well-being, and environmental assessments are at stake, the issue of EO data quality and quantification of errors and their impacts has gained increasing salience. This paper presents a generalizable decision-theoretic framework for quantifying the value of data quality (partly through improved calibration), and demonstrates its application for a water quality monitoring case. Results from the particular case of freshwater monitoring show that after 30\% or more probability of occurrence of a harmful algal bloom, remote sensing is useful to have regardless of the data quality level. However, factors such as cost of remote sensing data (in this case, comparing internal processing vs. external processing of tasked satellite imagery) will affect the threshold at which remote sensing value is positive regardless of data quality level.},

Our study highlights that precipitation, temperature and cyclone frequency explain 74\% of the global trends in maximum canopy height, with other geophysical factors influencing the observed variability at local and regional scales. We find the tallest mangrove forests in Gabon, equatorial Africa, where stands attain 62.8\,m. The total global mangrove carbon stock (above- and belowground biomass, and soil) is estimated at 5.03\,Pg, with a quarter of this value stored in Indonesia. Our analysis implies sensitivity of mangrove structure to climate change, and offers a baseline to monitor national and regional trends in mangrove carbon stocks.},

Each panelist was asked to (i) provide an opening statement and elaborate on their experience with failure, (ii) describe when failure is appropriate, (iii) describe how we learn and react to failure, and (iv) identify and discuss techniques to improve how systems engineers react to failure. Several common themes arose from the discussion including: failure is an option, the importance of failure to allow reassessment, and more process is not the solution. Each of these is discussed in turn along with future directions identified for reacting to and learning from failure. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng},

In The Mystery of Capital, the world-famous Peruvian economist takes up one of the most pressing questions the world faces today: Why do some countries succeed at capitalism while others fail?In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly extralegal property arrangements, such as squatting on large estates, to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book revolutionized our understanding of capital and points the way to a major transformation of the world economy.},

The ecological and economic valuation of the services performed by the Potengi estuary mangrove wetlands, mainly as biogeochemical barrier for the transport of P, N and heavy metals in tropical coastal areas, were obtained just as if the retention of those elements was necessary by Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTP) with Stabilization Ponds, typical in the estuary, and Zeolitic plant, respectively. Closer to real scenarios were observed for obtaining the values of these ecological services, such as the release of the P, N and heavy metals in domestic and industrial sewage in the estuary, the capability of dilution and the influence of the tides in the estuary. The tourism potential of the Potengi estuary mangrove wetlands were assessed according to the current forms of use, and potential of aquaculture through the main types of farming in mangrove areas. For these ecological services, considerable values were obtained of about USS15,500/ha, such as costs of implementation and construction of sewage treatment plants, as well as costs of sewage treatment plants.

  abstract = {Brazil has a monitoring system to track annual forest conversion in the Amazon and most recently to monitor the Cerrado biome. However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89\% ranging from 73 to 95\% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46\% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172\%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.},

This study proposes a multicriteria involvement process to enhance transparency and stakeholder participation and applies it to a contaminated sediment management case study for Bergen Harbor, Norway. The suggested multicriteria involvement process builds on the quantitative principles of multicriteria decision analysis and also incorporates group interaction and learning through qualitative participatory methods. Three different advisory groups consisting of local residents, local stakeholders, and nonresident sediment experts were invited to participate in a stakeholder engagement process to provide consensual comparative advice on sediment remediation alternatives. In order for stakeholders or residents to be able to embrace a complex decision such as selection of remediation alternatives, the involvement process with lateral learning, combined with multicriteria decision analysis providing structure, robustness and transparent documentation was preferable. In addition, a multicriteria involvement process resulted in consistent ranking of remediation alternatives across residents, stakeholder, and experts, relative to individual intuitive ranking without the multicriteria involvement process.

A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately \$370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly (\$55,000\textendash\$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.},

  abstract = {Airport planners, in determining the long-term development of an airport's infrastructure, estimate future use of the airport by using two loose categories of methods: (a) peer group learning and (b) forecasting. In peer group learning, airport planners compare their airports with like airports and engage in peer-to-peer exchange of information about lessons learned from past experiences and technical and planning guidance. The blend of quantitative and qualitative methodologies can be a powerful tool for airport planners because the planners can validate their forecasts with the actual experiences at similar airports. In the current state of the aviation industry, airport planners must engage in peer group learning because the environment in which they are planning their airports is more volatile than it was previously; however, while forecasting has been well studied by scholars and airport planners, peer group learning has attracted relatively less attention. Given the role of peer group learning in airport planning, airport planners must pay careful attention to how they define their peers in ever-evolving economic and industrial environments. Since deregulation of the airline industry in the 1970s, the airport system has become much more nuanced and is no longer easily defined, while airport planners often resort to single metrics such as enplanements as a peer criterion. This study developed and tested a peer identification methodology that reflects volatilities in the economy and the airport industry by using an expanded list of both static and dynamic metrics. This methodology highlights an important lesson that metrics matter in the ways in which airports identify their peers, benchmark their performance, and help to improve their plans.},

The challenge of coordinating tremendous sources of data and systems becomes paramount. Some key questions require additional attention if analyzing agricultural drought in a large social-environmental context: preprocessing observation into analysis-ready format, integrate vegetation/soil observations across platforms, and assess potential risks on the crop yield and environment. Cyberinfrastructure capable of accepting data from either research and monitoring networks or professionals in agricultural activities, must be built to achieve these goals. The cyberinfrastructure design generally consists of four components: data source, standardized web service, application service, and client interface. This study introduces a cloud-based global agricultural drought monitoring and forecasting system (GADMFS) which provides scalable vegetation-based drought indicators derived from satellite-, and model-based vegetation condition datasets. The provided datasets include global historical drought severity data from the monitoring component. The system is a significant extension to current capabilities and datasets from global drought assessment and early warning. The experiment results show that GADMFS successfully captured the major drought events in history and reflected the high-resolution spatial distribution which can specifically assist agriculture stakeholders to make informative decisions and take proactive drought management actions.},

The ground terrain and building rooftop patches are then extracted utilizing our technique, the hierarchical Euclidean clustering. Our method adopts a ``divide-and-conquer'' strategy. Once potential points on rooftops are segmented from terrain and vegetative areas, the whole scene is divided into individual pendent processing units which represent potential building footprints. For each individual building region, significant features on the rooftop are further detected using a specifically designed region growing algorithm with smoothness constraint. Boundaries for all of these features are refined in order to produce strict description. After this refinement, mesh models could be generated using an existing robust dual contouring method.},

TECHCOM, a scenario approach, displays and analyzes information to reach the best solution for a large-scale complex system. Utility Analysis, a qualitative approach, interacts directly with decision makers to find preferences for different objectives. Using this optimization structure many submodels are developed such as agricultural models, recreational development models, wildlife preservation models, and flooding control models.

  abstract = {The term complexity is used in many different ways in the systems domain. The different uses of this term may depend upon the kind of system being characterized, or perhaps the disciplinary perspective being brought to bear. The purpose of this paper is to gather and organize different views of complexity, as espoused by different authors. The purpose of the paper is not to make judgments among various complexity definitions, but rather to draw together the richness of various intellectual perspectives about this concept, in order to understand better how complexity relates to the concept of engineering systems. I have either quoted directly or done my best to properly paraphrase these ideas, apologizing for when I have done so incorrectly or in a misleading fashion. I hope that this paper will be useful as we begin to think through the field of engineering systems. The paper concludes with some short takes -- pungent observations on complexity by various scholars -- and some overarching questions for subsequent discussion},

A computerized model was constructed which employs selectable reliability and failure distributions to interrelate the performance of an hsgt system in terms of adherence to established schedule and the various reliability and failure parameters on the subsystem and component level. The model is based upon an analytic combination of the conditional reliability and failure distribution. Three train failure modes, distinguished by the limiting speed encountered for the various component failure contributions, are considered. These lead to the overall probability of reduced operating performance for a train and, finally, to the probability distribution of delays in a network. The computer output information is prepared so as to be compatible input to a TRANSIM simulation program developed under an associated system engineering support task. (Author)},

The main point is that in many cases it is beneficial, both timewise and costwise, to pursue the incremental integration methodology. It turns out to be more robust to process uncertainties.

Focusing on two areas of contention, forced evictions and police brutality, the article considers the way activists framed their grievances and how mainstream international media outlets reported those grievances. While activists fighting against forced evictions explicitly used the language of rights in their activism, media accounts tended not to discuss these issues using this lexicon. Conversely, grassroots activists protesting around the issue of police brutality did not tend to frame their grievances in terms of rights, but these issues were discussed as human rights abuses in the media. This points to a dual role played by activists fighting forced evictions: while they are fighting to keep their own homes, they are also part of a wider discursive battle for the right to housing to be recognised and respected.},

One reason for this destruction is that the benefits of mangroves have not been valued in a way that policymakers and markets can understand. Here, we present the first economic valuation of multiple ecosystem services (ES) for Ecuador and the TEP using the Galapagos mangroves as a case study. We focused on three ES of high value and policy relevance: carbon storage, support for small-scale fisheries, and mangrove-based tourism. Our data suggest that over 778,000 tons of carbon are stored in Galapagos mangroves, with mean belowground carbon being 211.03\,{$\pm$}\,179.65\,Mg C/ha, valued at \$2940/ha or \$22,838/ha depending on the valuation methodology. We identified mangrove-dependent fish targeted by the local finfish fishery, with net benefits of \$245\,ha-1, making this fishery the second most profitable in the Archipelago. The value of mangrove-based recreation was estimated at \$16,958/ha, contributing \$62 million to the industry. By accounting for stakeholders and existing property rights, our results allow for the discussion of institutionalizing ES payments for the Galapagos Islands.},

The optimum degree of saturation (Sr)opt defined as Sr when ({$\rho$}d)max is obtained and the {$\rho$}d/({$\rho$}d)max vs. Sr - (Sr)opt relation of compacted soil are independent of CEL and insensitive to soil type variations. The strength and stiffness of unsoaked and soaked compacted soil and the hydraulic conductivity k of saturated compacted soil are controlled by {$\rho$}d and ``Sr during compaction''. Empirical equations of CBR and k expressing these trends of behaviour, not including CEL, were derived by analyzing existing data.

  abstract = {This paper explores the potential for interaction between the development of geographic information systems (GIS) and the development of geographical methodology in the next decade. Several interrelated themes occur throughout the paper: first, trends in the nature and extent of GIS development; second, opportunities for geographic investigation inherent in those developments; and third, contributions that geographers can make to the design of GIS It is suggested that GIS offer a wealth of geo-referenced data for potential use in modeling, as well as the capabilities to handle such data in geographical models. Geographers, in turn, can contribute to GIS design in ways that will enhance their capabilities and also facilitate geographical investigations. The incorporation of the quantitative geographical methods of the 1950s and 1960s with the GIS capabilities of the 1990s is foreseen This article's fourth theme is the concern over the critical shortage of trained persons competent in GIS technology and possessing a knowledge of spatial analytic methods. This may in itself be the limiting factor to the rational development of the field in the next decade. Suggestions are made for the types of training needed to remedy the problem. The fifth theme is the view of GIS from a global perspective, including the role of Canadian geographers in analysing global problems similar to those they face in Canada It is suggested that a convergence of the technologies for the gathering, storage, analysis, and display of georeferenced data occurring at local, regional, national multinational, and global scales has a potential in the next decade for an enriched geographical methodology Dans cet article, on explore les possibilit\'es dinteractions entrp l'\'elaboration des syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique et celle des m\'ethodes g\'eographiques au cours de la prochaine d\'ecennie. Plusieurs th\`emes \'etroitement li\'es reviennent dans l'article. D'abord, on peut distinguer certaines orientations dans la nature et la port\'ee de l'\'evolution des syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique. Ensuite, il en ressort que quelques unes d'entre-elles pourraient faire l'objet d'enqu\^etes g\'eographiques. Troisi\`emement, plusieurs contributions pourraient \^etre apport\'ees par les g\'eographes \`a la conception des syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique.

  abstract = {Historically, multipurpose land information systems have often been designed for use as community-wide enterprises. Before becoming useful to the community, however, many of these systems encounter prohibitive factors delaying or preventing the satisfaction of the ultimate goals for which they were designed. A criticism of current models is that system developers seeking to build publicly accessible systems do not use them. Since most systems are developed without the guidance of a formal model, system developers often do not fully anticipate likely system issues. Many systems, designed on an ad hoc basis, fail to achieve their full potential, because they have not used an appropriate model to determine a final system outcome. This paper presents a theoretical model describing the stages systems experience during development. These stages are: no development, system initiation, database development, recordkeeping, analysis, and democratization. Additionally, the factors promoting or prohibiting movement from one stage to the next, and the indicators or outcomes of each stage are described. Not only are the individual elements described but also their relationships are described as part of the model. The Multipurpose Land Information System (MPLIS) development model is designed both as a guide for system developers and a tool for discussing and comparing systems.},

Here, she illuminates our present search for authentic connection in a time of uncharted challenges. Turkle has spent a career composing an intimate ethnography of our digital world; now, marked by insight, humility, and compassion, we have her own.In this vivid and poignant narrative, Turkle ties together her coming-of-age and her pathbreaking research on technology, empathy, and ethics. Growing up in postwar Brooklyn,Turkle searched for clues to her identity in a house filled with mysteries. She mastered the codes that governed her mother's secretive life. She learned never to ask about her absent scientist father--and never to use his name, her name. Before empathy became a way to find connection, it was her strategy for survival.Turkle's intellect and curiosity brought her to worlds on the threshold of change. She learned friendship at a Harvard-Radcliffe on the cusp of coeducation during the antiwar movement, she mourned the loss of her mother in Paris as students returned from the 1968 barricades, and she followed her ambition while fighting for her place as a woman and a humanist at MIT. There, Turkle found turbulent love and chronicled the wonders of the new computer culture, even as she warned of its threat to our most essential human connections. The Empathy Diaries captures all this in rich detail--and offers a master class in finding meaning through a life's work.},

The adverse impacts of government-mandated social distancing measures on individuals are generally unknown. Vulnerable populations, such as low-income individuals, face unique challenges managing their safety, means, and autonomy in response to the policies implemented on local levels to curb the spread of COVID-19. This endeavor aims to understand the invisible variables that contribute to vulnerable individuals personal security during the hardships imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and institutional response. The Space Enabled Research Group has pioneered this framework to conceptualize overall wellbeing during the pandemic, of Personal Security. Personal Security is conceptualized as the interplay between an individuals perceived Safetye.g. their ability to live without risk of harm, their Resourcese.g. financial resources, and Autonomye.g. their ability to optimize their life to meet the needs of themselves and their dependents. This endeavor examines the impact of social distancing policies on individuals personal security in six sectors of life: housing, income and finances, employment, wellness, family and dependents, and healthcareby interviewing individuals living in Greater Boston during the pandemic about their experiences. Preliminary results indicate meta-themes around the impact of decision-making length, willingness to act decisively when much is unknown, the role if misinformation, and transportationto be impacting individuals in Greater Boston adversely during the pandemic. The role of organizational decision-making and an organizations willingness to act decisively is a key metric impacting the lives of individuals during the pandemic. Findings from this study indicate that organizational decisiveness is a key metric that local policy-makers and organization leads should optimize for in order to reduce burden on vulnerable individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results are important in the scope of the pandemic as well as in the scope of ongoing climate-related infrastructural disasters.},

Collaborative modeling is an increasingly-used approach to enable effective science-based decision-making. This work evaluates the modeling process conducted for two hydropower dam licensing negotiations, to explore how differences in the collaborative development of hydrological models affected differences in their use in subsequent decision-making. In one case, the model was developed iteratively through deliberation with stakeholders. Consequently, stakeholders understood the model and its limitations and trusted the model and modelers; the model itself was also better designed to evaluate resource managers' questions. The collaboratively-developed model became the focal point for subsequent negotiations and enabled creative group problem-solving. Conversely, in the case with less engagement during model development, the model was not used subsequently by decision-makers. These differences are argued to result from trust built during the modeling process, applicability of the model to test real management scenarios, and the broader social context in which the models were used.},

  abstract = {Given the challenges related to climate change and dependency from fossil fuels, modification of the energy systems infrastructure to increase the share of renewable energy is a priority in urban energy planning. The high heating density in cities makes it more economically competitive to deploy district heating (DH), which is essential for large-scale integration of renewable energy sources. Combining georeferenced data with district heating design methods allows to improve the quality of the system design. However, increasing the spatial resolution can lead to intractable model sizes. This paper presents a methodology to spatially assess the integration of DH networks in urban energy systems. Given georeferenced data of buildings, resource availability and road networks, the methodology allows the identification of promising sites for DH deployment. First, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model divides the urban system into spatial clusters (of buildings). Graph theory and routing methods are then used to optimally design the DH configuration in each cluster considering the road network in the routing algorithm. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is formulated in order to economically evaluate the DH integration over the whole urban area. The proposed methodology is applied to an example case study, evaluating the use of geothermal energy (deep aquifer) for direct heat supply. The results of the optimization show the interest of deploying geothermal DH in some of the clusters. The profitability of DH integration is strongly affected by the spatial density of the heating demand.},

Last revised in 1983, the work now provides a comprehensive practitioner-oriented study of the state of the art of regional and local economic development planning, with emphasis on specific project activity arrived at through an analysis of the regional economic context. The book is written in a straightforward style, free of technical terms and jargon, and is suitable for readers without an extensive background in economics, mathematics, or statistics. In addition, all analytical work is presented in a form that can be carried out without the use of vast databases or computers.Bendavid-Val divides his work into five basic parts, each covering a different feature or method of analysis and planning. Part one introduces important aspects of the overall economic and development context within which the methods of regional analysis are used. Parts two, three, and four offer an introduction to common descriptive methods of analysis for use in regional planning, covering aggregate regional analysis, intraregional analysis, and project identification and evaluation. Finally, part five deals with approaches to regional development planning, providing help in selecting the methods that will be most useful in a given situation. A selected bibliography concludes the book. This work contains everything the practitioner or student needs in order to understand what regional and local economic development is all about, as well as to acquire the basic analytical skills for regional development planning, and to design and carry out a regional development planning process. Public and academic libraries will find this updated and expanded edition to be a significant addition to their collections, and for students and practitioners in regional planning and development, it will be an essential reference source.},

  abstract = {The modern warfighter operates in an environment that has dramatically evolved in sophistication and interconnectedness over the past half century. With each passing year, the infusion of ever more complex technologies and integrated systems places increasing burdens on acquisition officers to make decisions regarding potential programs with respect to the joint capability portfolio. Furthermore, significant cost overruns in recent acquisition programs reveal that, despite efforts since 2010 to ensure the affordability of systems, additional work is needed to develop enhanced approaches and methods. This paper discusses research that builds on prior work that explored system design tradespaces for affordability under uncertainty, extending it to the program and portfolio level. Time-varying exogenous factors, such as resource availability, stakeholder needs, or production delays, may influence the potential for value contribution by constituent systems over the lifecycle of a portfolio, and make an initially attractive design less attractive over time. This paper introduces a method to conduct portfolio design for affordability by augmenting Epoch-Era Analysis with aspects of Modern Portfolio Theory. The method is demonstrated through the design of a carrier strike group portfolio involving the integration of multiple legacy systems with the acquisition of new vessels.},

  abstract = {To detect changes during the Late Holocene and historical periods in Guanabara Bay, the paleoecological and ecological parameters from nine cores were analysed using foraminiferal assemblages and bioindicators. Using radiocarbon dates and sedimentation rates in the cores, it was possible to detect the first Europeans' arrival in the 16th century. Foraminiferal bioindicators of organic matter and human pollution were correlated with radiocarbon dates from the bottom and middle of the cores in each region and revealed an increase in pollution along the cores. The foraminiferal results were compared with total organic carbon (TOC) values before, during and after European settlement and showed a historical increase in organic matter. Pristine mangrove ecosystems are characterised by agglutinated species such as Ammotium salsum, and the presence of this organism also confirmed the extent of historical mangrove forests. Ammonia tepida, Buliminella elegantissima and Elphidium excavatum were the dominant species, but they presented distinct patterns over time. B. elegantissima was dominant before the European influence in older sediments with high organic matter content that were found at deeper intervals. A. tepida is dominant in younger sediments at upper intervals, as a bioindicator of human pollution.},

This new edition of the leading textbook on government and business policy explains how the latest theoretical and empirical economic tools can be employed to analyze pressing regulatory and antitrust issues. The book departs from the common emphasis on institutions, focusing instead on the relevant underlying economic issues, using state-of-the-art analysis to assess the appropriate design of regulatory and antitrust policy. Extensive case studies illustrate fundamental principles and provide insight on key issues in regulation and antitrust policy. This fifth edition has been thoroughly revised and updated, reflecting both the latest developments in economic analysis and recent economic events. The text examines regulatory practices through the end of the Obama and beginning of the Trump administrations. New material includes coverage of global competition and the activities of the European Commission; recent mergers, including Comcast-NBC Universal; antitrust in the new economy, including investigations into Microsoft and Google; the financial crisis of 2007\textendash 2008 and the Dodd-Frank Act; the FDA approval process; climate change policies; and behavioral economics as a tool for designing regulatory strategies.},

Full of practical examples and case studies, the book shows how CommunityViz can enliven the comprehensive planning process from visioning, to public participation, to values mapping, to build-out analysis. Chapters show how to use CommunityViz to analyze zoning regulations, calculate the costs of community services, and evaluate development proposals requiring design review. In addition, it is applicable to transportation planning, natural-resource planning, land-development suitability assessment, and urban economic development analysis.},

Through the improvement of the lifeyears loss theory and the analysis of the value of the method parameters, the calculation scheme was determined. A comparative study was conducted on the lifeyears loss of earthquake in China grouped by years and regions. The relationship between the total lifeyears loss and its influence factors, such as the affected population, the epicentral intensity, the earthquake magnitude and recovery time was studied. The results showed that four influencing factors were all positively correlated with the total lifeyears loss. The affected population has the greatest correlation and the correlation of the other three factors is decreasing in turn. The linear regression model, the neural network quantile regression model and the nonlinear model of gene expression programming were established on the basis of the analysis of the influencing factors and the comparative analysis was carried out. Earthquake disaster loss was evaluated and predicted by using the evaluation model, which reduced data dependence and simplified the assessment process.  2019, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

Three temperatures (room temperature, 40oC and 55oC) were adopted in the testing program. After exposed in SWSSC solution for 21, 42 and 63 days, respectively, each specimen was tested to failure. The test results showed that the tensile strength degradation rates of BFRP bars within SWSSC solution are slightly higher than those under alkaline solution generated from normal concrete at room temperature and 40oC condition, while at 55oC SWSSC solution appears much more aggressive than alkaline solution. The Youngs modulus of all BFRP bar specimens basically keeps unchanged after exposure to SWSSC solution for 63 days. Finally, the prediction of long-term performance of BFRP bars under SWSSC environment at five Australian capital cities is proposed, and the expected time corresponding to the tensile strength retention 50\% was conservatively estimated.

Now, it's increasingly about complex systems. As the airplane taxis to the gate, you access the Internet and check email with your PDA, linking the communication and transportation systems. At home, you recharge your plug-in hybrid vehicle, linking transportation to the electricity grid. Today's large-scale, highly complex sociotechnical systems converge, interact, and depend on each other in ways engineers of old could barely have imagined. As scale, scope, and complexity increase, engineers consider technical and social issues together in a highly integrated way as they design flexible, adaptable, robust systems that can be easily modified and reconfigured to satisfy changing requirements and new technological opportunities.Engineering Systems offers a comprehensive examination of such systems and the associated emerging field of study. Through scholarly discussion, concrete examples, and history, the authors consider the engineer's changing role, new ways to model and analyze these systems, the impacts on engineering education, and the future challenges of meeting human needs through the technologically enabled systems of today and tomorrow.},

  abstract = {The design of technical systems such as automobiles and spacecraft has traditionally focused exclusively on performance maximization. Many organizations now realize that such an approach must be balanced against competing objectives of cost, risk, and other criteria. If one is willing to give up some amount of performance relative to the best achievable performance level, one introduces slack into system design. This slack can be invested in creating better outcomes overall. One way to achieve this is to balance the requirements among contributing subsystems such that the number of active constraints is minimized, while still achieving the desired system performance. This paper introduces a methodology called ``isoperformance'' as a means of identifying and evaluating a performance-invariant set of design solutions, which are efficient in terms of other criteria such as cost, risk, and lifecycle properties. Isoperformance is an inverse design method that starts from a desired vector of performance requirements and works backwards to identify acceptable solutions in the design space. To achieve this, gradient-based contour following is implemented as a multivariable search algorithm that manipulates the null set of the Jacobian matrix. Use of the method is illustrated with two examples from spacecraft design and human performance in sports. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 9: 45\textendash 61, 2006},

  abstract = {The high cost of launching resources from the Earth's surface is a significant barrier to future longduration human space exploration. A future resource economy in space may allow resource production, processing, storage, and transportation at distributed locations, but will have many stakeholders with varied and potentially competing objectives. Simulation games provide a medium for communication and learning richer than papers or linear presentations by combining the technical capabilities of simulation models with human interaction. Building on technology powering military wargames, federated simulation architectures such as HLA-Evolved use independently-developed simulation models connected over a distributed network of computers. This paper presents an approach for developing a multi-player simulation gaming environment where human players take on roles of organizations or government agencies within scenarios designed to address the design and operation of a resource economy in space. The game design addresses the number of players, time advancement, level of abstraction, scenario selection, and other decisions based on past simulation games in the domains of military-political, educational, disaster response, and business-management games. Future research will focus on evaluating game executions to analyze human decision-making under various scenarios. Quantitative analysis of decisions using game logs combined with qualitative analysis of interviews and surveys will contribute to strategies for a future resource economy in space.},

For realistic parameter values, the model produces fractal or bifractal land-use structures for the urbanized area and for each individual land-use type. Data for a set of US cities show that they have very similar fractal dimensions. The cellular approach makes it possible to achieve a high level of spatial detail and realism and to link the results directly to general theories of structural evolution.}

The analysis estimates the marginal impact of each type and level of policy as implemented in concert with other policies. The purpose is to provide policymakers and the general public with an estimate of the relative effectiveness of various COVID-control strategies. We find that a set of widely implemented core policies reduces the spread of virus but not by enough to contain the pandemic except in a few highly compliant jurisdictions. The core policies include the cancellation of public events, restriction of gatherings to fewer than 100 people, recommendation to stay at home, recommended restrictions on internal movement, implementation of a partial international travel ban, and coordination of information campaigns. For the median jurisdiction, these policies reduce growth rate in new infections from an estimated 270\% per week to approximately 49\% per week, but this impact is insufficient to prevent eventual transmission throughout the population because containment occurs only when a jurisdiction reduces growth in COVID infection to below zero. Most jurisdictions must also implement additional policies, each of which has the potential to reduce weekly COVID growth rate by 10 percentage points or more. The slate of these additional high-impact policies includes targeted or full workplace closings for all but essential workers, stay-at-home requirements, and targeted school closures.},

  abstract = {At the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of Europe's cities experienced a population decrease. Dealing with the results of demographic, economic and physical contraction processes and planning for the future of considerably smaller but nevertheless livable cities presents some of the most challenging tasks for urban Europe in the near future. This article highlights the example of Dresden in Eastern Germany, where the breakdown of the state-directed economy caused economic decline, industrial regression, and high unemployment rates. Due to out migration and decreasing birth rates, the city lost 60,000 of its 500,000 residents within one decade. As a consequence, there were housing and office vacancies as well as infrastructure oversupplies. Yet the administrative system was still directed towards growth objectives throughout the 1990s. Only after 2000 this situation changed dramatically. The new strategic plan for Dresden is no longer growth oriented. Instead, it focuses on a model of the compact `European city', with an attractive urban centre, reduced land consumption, and a stable population. However, in another unexpected turn of events, within the last seven years the city has experienced an unexpected growth of 25,000 residents. Surprisingly, processes of suburbanization have turned into processes of reurbanization. Today in Dresden, areas of shrinkage and decline are in close proximity to prospering and wealthy communities. The strategic challenge is to deal with this patchwork while accepting that the future remains unpredictable. Hence, strategic flexibility becomes more important than the strategy itself. To a certain extent rational analysis and error prevention is displaced by preparedness, robustness, and resilience as key qualifications of planning in shrinking cities. \textdagger I am grateful to the members of the Shrinking Cities International Research Network (SCiRNTM), in particular Sylvie Fol and Cristina Martinez-Fernandez, for instructive discussions on various aspects of shrinking cities and to anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions on an earlier draft.},

  abstract = {Maps are changing. They have become important and fashionable once more. Rethinking Maps brings together leading researchers to explore how maps are being rethought, made and used, and what these changes mean for working cartographers, applied mapping research, and cartographic scholarship. It offers a contemporary assessment of the diverse forms that mapping now takes and, drawing upon a number of theoretic perspectives and disciplines, provides an insightful commentary on new ontological and epistemological thinking with respect to cartography.  This book presents a diverse set of approaches to a wide range of map forms and activities in what is presently a rapidly changing field. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach to important contemporary mapping practices, with chapters written by leading theorists who have an international reputation for innovative thinking. Much of the new research around mapping is emerging as critical dialogue between practice and theory and this book has chapters focused on intersections with play, race and cinema. Other chapters discuss cartographic representation, sustainable mapping and visual geographies. It also considers how alternative models of map creation and use such as open-source mappings and map mash-up are being creatively explored by programmers, artists and activists. There is also an examination of the work of various `everyday mappers' in diverse social and cultural contexts.   This blend of conceptual chapters and theoretically directed case studies provides an excellent resource suited to a broad spectrum of researchers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in human geography, GIScience and cartography, visual anthropology, media studies, graphic design and computer graphics. Rethinking Maps is a necessary and significant text for all those studying or having an interest in cartography.},

From questions of identity and subjectivity, it moves to a consideration of the places where people and animals confront the realities of coexistence on an everyday basis, by way of case studies of species such as mountain lions and the golden eagle.

The study addresses diverse examples of approaches used to master, adapt, diffuse and apply satellite technology in emerging countries. The work focuses on government programs that represent the nation and deliver services that provide public goods such as environmental monitoring. An original framework developed by the authors examines implementation approaches and contextual factors using the concept of Systems Architecture. The Systems Architecture analysis defines the satellite programs as systems within a context which execute functions via forms in order to achieve stakeholder objectives. These Systems Architecture definitions are applied to case studies of six satellite projects executed by countries in Africa and Asia. The architectural models used by these countries in various projects reveal patterns in the areas of training, technical specifications and partnership style. Based on these patterns, three Archetypal Project Architectures are defined which link the contextual factors to the implementation approaches. The three Archetypal Project Architectures lead to distinct opportunities for training, capability building and end user services. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IAA.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the process of building technological capability in government-led satellite programs within developing countries. The key message is that these satellite programs can learn useful lessons from literature in the international development community. These lessons are relevant to emerging satellite programs that leverage international partnerships in order to establish local capability to design, build and operate satellites. Countries with such programs include Algeria, Nigeria, Turkey, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. The paper first provides background knowledge about space activity in developing countries, and then explores the nuances of the lessons coming from the international development literature. Developing countries are concerned with satellite technology because satellites provide useful services in the areas of earth observation, communication, navigation and science. Most developing countries access satellite services through indirect means such as sharing data with foreign organizations. More countries, however, are seeking opportunities to develop satellite technology locally. There are objective, technically driven motivations for developing countries to invest in satellite technology, despite rich debate on this topic. The paper provides a framework to understand technical motivations for investment in satellite services, hardware, expertise and infrastructure in both short and long term. If a country decides to pursue such investments they face a common set of strategic decisions at the levels of their satellite program, their national context and their international relationships. Analysis of past projects shows that countries have chosen diverse strategies to address these strategic decisions and grow in technological capability. What is similar about the historical examples is that many countries choose to leverage international partnerships as part of their growth process. There are also historical examples from outside the space arena in which organizations have pursued technological capability. Scholars have analyzed these examples and developed insightful frameworks. The paper draws key concepts from this literature about the nature of development, technology, knowledge and organizational learning. These concepts are relevant to learning in new satellite programs, but the ideas must be applied cautiously because of the nature of satellite technology. The paper draws three major lessons from the international development literature regarding absorptive capacity, tacit knowledge and organizational learning; it synthesizes these lessons into a cohesive, original framework. The closing section proposes future work on a detailed study of technological learning in specific government satellite programs. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The analysis is unfolded in three stages. The first stage introduces a framework called the Space Technology Ladder. This Ladder framework posits a path through four major technology categories, as follows: 1) establishing a national space agency; 2) owning and operating a satellite in low Earth orbit; 3) owning and operating a satellite in geostationary orbit; and 4) launching satellites. The second stage of the analysis uses data to create a graphical timeline, by mapping the historical achievements of the eight countries onto the Ladder framework. The results provide information about the similarities and differences in the technology strategies of the various countries. The third stage is a discussion of the strategic decisions faced by the countries under study. Exploring their diverse strategies is an initial step toward developing prescriptive theory to inform developing country space programs. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Space technology and resources are used around the world to address societal challenges. Space provides valuable satellite services, unique scientific discoveries, surprising technology applications and new economic opportunities. Many developing countries formally recognize the advantages of space resources and pursue national level activity to harness them. There is limited data or documentation on the space activities of developing countries. Meanwhile, traditional approaches to summarize national space activity do not necessarily capture the types of activity that developing countries pursue in space. This is especially true if they do not have a formal national space program or office. Developing countries pursue national space activity through activities of many types - from national satellite programs to commercial use of satellite services to involvement with international space institutions. This research aims to understand and analyze these trends. This paper introduces two analytical frameworks for evaluating space activity at the national level. The frameworks are specifically designed to capture the activity of countries that have traditionally been less involved in space. They take a broad view of space related activity across multiple societal sectors and disciplines. The discussion explains the approach for using the frameworks as well as illustrative examples of how they can be applied as part of a research process. The first framework is called the Mission and Management Ladders. This framework considers specific space projects within countries and ranks them on Ladders that measure technical challenge and managerial autonomy. This first method is at a micro level of analysis. The second framework is called the Space Participation Metric (SPM). The SPM can be used to assign a Space Participation score to countries based on their involvement in various space related activities. This second method uses a macro level of analysis. The authors developed both frameworks as part of a long term research program about the space activities of developing countries.

  abstract = {Satellite technology in the areas of remote sensing, communication, and navigation can provide valuable information in a number of areas from business to disaster management to agriculture. There is great potential for such technology to help solve problems in developing countries. Unfortunately, due to lack of funds, expertise, equipment or awareness, developing countries are not using satellite technology to its full potential. This thesis is motivated by a desire to increase and improve the use of satellite-based technology in developing countries. Three Research Questions guide the study. Question 1 is, ``How does national development level relate to national space activity?'' For this question, national development level is measured by a series of Development Indicators such as Gross Domestic Product. The level of space activity is measured using a Space Participation Metric that is created by the author. Statistical analysis is used to learn if there is any significant difference in the space activity of countries at different development levels. Research Question 2 asks, ``What Mission and Management Architectures are developing countries using to apply satellite-based technology to national needs?'' The data used to answer this question comes from 90 Space Project Case Studies about satellite-enabled activities in Africa. The information from the Case Studies is organized so that trends can be found in the accomplishments of the projects. Research Question 3 asks, ``How does national development level influence the Mission and Management Architectures used by developing countries in satellite-based technology projects?'' This question builds on the data from Research Question 2. Statistical},

Through the definition of congestion buses, the size of promising candidate lines is greatly reduced. Moreover, to make a trade-off between the integrity of the candidate set and the computation time, linear relaxation is applied. Two case studies verified the performance of the proposed approach.},

However, due to insufficient studies on the evaluation of the service life of FRPs under various conditions, long-term behavior of FRP strengthened/reinforced structures, and the life cycle design of FRPs in major structures has not been well developed. Focusing on the above limitations, the authors team has conducted a series of innovative research over the past ten years on developing advanced basalt FRP composites and various stable composite products. Subsequently, are proposing evaluation methods addressing long-term behavior of FRPs under cyclic and sustained load and their enhancement through hybridization, matrix modification, and pretension treatment. Based on the understanding of the long-term behavior of FRP composites, further evaluation of the long-term interface behavior of FRP strengthened concrete structure and their enhancement are herein proposed for the longevity design of strengthening existing RC structures. Meanwhile, to address the longevity design of new construction with FRPs, the philosophy and the methods to realize high performance and longevity of FRP cable supported bridges are introduced.

We present an investigation of remotely estimating midday LUE using the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen) derived from the cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images in maize, coniferous forest and grassland. Similar temporal patterns are observed in both canopy chlorophyll content and midday LUE which indicates that the chlorophyll content in the maize canopy servers as a proxy of midday LUE (R2=0.736, p{$<$}0.001). Therefore, the CIgreen, tested as a good indicator of canopy chlorophyll content (R2=0.840, p{$<$}0.001), has been demonstrated to be a reliable candidate in providing reasonable estimates of midday LUE with determination coefficient R2 equals to 0.820 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.002mol CO2 per mol incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Further validation of the prediction model derived from the maize site demonstrates that the CIgreen has potential to be applied in the coniferous forest and grassland ecosystems with RMSE of 0.005 and 0.004molCO2mol-1 PPFD, respectively. A comparison analysis between different vegetation types is included and these results could be helpful in the development of future LUE and terrestrial models.},

Controlling for location-specific fixed effects and local policies, we found a negative relationship between the estimated reproduction number and temperatures above 25oC, a U-shaped relationship with outdoor ultraviolet exposure, and weaker positive associations with air pressure, wind speed, precipitation, diurnal temperature, SO2 and ozone. We projected the relative risk of COVID-19 transmission due to environmental factors in 1,072 global cities. Our projections suggest warmer temperature and moderate outdoor ultraviolet exposure may offer a modest reduction in transmission; however, upcoming changes in weather alone will not be enough to fully contain the transmission of COVID-19.},

The enhanced water information using the NDWI is often mixed with built-up land noise and the area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region with a background dominated by built-up land areas because of its advantage in reducing and even removing built-up land noise over the NDWI.},

We combine our theoretical reasoning with a multiscale approach and with fractal-like argumentation which results in a frame of conditions which is supported by the outline of a theoretical conceptual simulation model which would also allow non-linear, iterative simulations of the urban space. The understanding of autonomous non-linear spatial development has a direct impact on planning. Addressing the underlying thinking behind Haken's synergetics we develop a framework within which the interdependencies between different levels of scale are key. We are aware that bottom-up and top-down processes often have a mutual influence on one another. We therefore propose a conceptual simulation model for planning where conditions have an impact at various levels of scale. In coherence with the idea of the `dynamic behaviour of the system after a planning decision was made', this feedback gives us information on the surviving and non-surviving planning scenarios and decisions and is reminiscent of systems which are open to self-organizing pattern formation. Our reasoning with regard to planning and decision-making and their multilevel consequences is strongly influenced by the arguments presented in complexity studies.},

However, a lack of stakeholder perspective, fragmented responses, and a dearth of integration across sectors have long been perceived as the SDGs' main pitfalls. In recent years, scholars are calling to address these issues by adopting a systems engineering perspective, as this approach espouses a stakeholder-focused position, embraces a holistic and dynamic mindset, and provides a variety of technical and managerial toolkits, which can help to untangle the complexity and interactions inherent in global sustainability. Nevertheless, little has been done to map the existing literature, comprehensively review, and synthesize research evidence in this field. Therefore, this paper aims to conduct a scoping study that analyzes the extant evidence to uncover the contributions of systems engineering in advancing the SDGs. A three-phase methodology integrating natural language processing and systematic literature review is used to investigate this space. We conclude that systems engineering has been an active catalyst promoting the SDGs, and that systems engineering has the potential to support more transdisciplinary research to achieve long-term transformational and sustainable change across sectors and disciplines.},

In one conclusion the IPCC states that developing countries will be most vulnerable to climate change; in another, the TAR reports that we are unable to predict adaptive responses to site-specific exposures to climate impacts.  Here we explore how variation in adaptive capacity and climate impacts can be seen to influence the global distribution of vulnerability. We find that all countries will be vulnerable to climate change, even if their adaptive capacities are enhanced.  Developing nations are most vulnerable to modest climate change, and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions would diminish their vulnerabilities significantly.  Developed countries would benefit most from mitigation for moderate climate change. Extreme climate change overwhelms the abilities of all countries to adapt.},

Specifically, we examine whether geographic localities characterised by high percentages of socially vulnerable populations experience significantly more casualties due to flood events, adjusting for characteristics of the natural and built environment. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models indicate that the odds of a flood casualty increase with the level of precipitation on the day of a flood event, flood duration, property damage caused by the flood, population density, and the presence of socially vulnerable populations. Odds decrease with the number of dams, the level of precipitation on the day before a recorded flood event, and the extent to which localities have enacted flood mitigation strategies. The study concludes with comments on hazard-resilient communities and protection of casualty-prone populations. \textcopyright{} Overseas Development Institute, 2008.},

  abstract = {Nokou\'e Lake is a complex ecosystem, the understanding of which requires control of physical processes that have occurred. For this, the Surface Water Modeling System (SMS) hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated on the water depth data. The results of these simulations show a good match between the simulated and observed data for bottom roughness and turbulent exchange coefficients, of 0.02 m-1/3\textperiodcentered s and 20 m2/s respectively. Once the ability of the model to simulate the hydrodynamics of the lake is testified, the model is used to simulate water surface elevation, exchanged flows and velocities. The simulation shows that the tidal amplitude is maximum at the inlet of the channel and decreases gradually from the inlet towards the lagoon's main body. The propagation of the tidal wave is characterized by the dephasing and the flattening of the amplitude tide, which increases as we move away from the channel. This dephasing is characterized by a high and low tides delay of about 1 or 4 h and also depends on the tide amplitude and location. The velocities inside the lake are very low and do not exceed 0.03 m/s. The highest are obtained at the entrance of the channel. In a flood period, in contrast with the low-water period, incoming flows are higher than outflows, reinforced by the amplitude of the tide. An average renewal time of the lake has been estimated and corresponds during a flood period to 30 days for an average amplitude tide and 26.3 days on a high amplitude tide. In a low water period it is 40.2 days for an average amplitude tide and 30 days for a high amplitude tide. From the results obtained, several measures must be taken into account for the rational management of the lake water resources. These include a dam construction at the lake upstream, to control the river flows, and the dredging of the channel to facilitate exchanges with the sea.},

However, in adapting scenario planning from its origins in the business sector, planners have eliminated two key components: (1) the use of multiple scenarios, and (2) the inclusion of diverse organizations, people, and interests through deep deliberations. We argue that this shift limits the ability of planners to plan for multiple plausible futures that are shaped by an increasing number of diverse actors. In this paper, we use case-study research to examine how uncertainty was considered in four scenario-planning processes. We analyzed and compared the cases based on analytical categories related to multiple futures and diversity. We found that the processes that used multiple, structurally distinct scenarios explored a wider range of topics and issues shaping places. All four relied heavily on professional stakeholders as the scenario developers, limiting public input. Only one of the processes that included multiple futures captured the differential effects that scenarios would have on diverse people and interests. Overall, the purpose of the scenario planning drove the participant diversity and ultimately the quality and use of the scenarios.},

  abstract = {Mangrove forests are productive ecosystems but are vulnerable to tropical cyclones. In this study, we quantified the damage of mangroves from Hurricane Irma at a large-scale using Landsat data, and modeled the risk of mangroves to hurricanes using three internal/physical metrics (a vegetation index, canopy height, and distance to open ocean) and two external/hurricane-related metrics (hurricane track and storm surge inundation). Four machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) were examined and compared with the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method to identify the best risk model for damage projection from future hurricanes. The models were calibrated and validated using data before and after Hurricane Irma. Machine learning algorithms had a better performance than the linear model, and RF achieved the best result with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84 in predicting mangrove damages. The model also produced an encouraging result to hindcast mangrove damages from Hurricane Wilma. We applied object-based modeling and mapping techniques and produced mangrove damage maps from Irma and a worst-case scenario hurricane with an intensity of Category 5 and a track along the mangrove distribution. A total of 332\,km2 of mangroves were severely damaged from Irma, and 635\,km2 would be devastated from the modeled scenario. The techniques developed here can be used for other mangrove forests exposed to tropical cyclones.},

  abstract = {Nonpoint source (NPS) water pollution is one of serious environmental issues, especially within an agricultural system. This study aims to propose a robust chance-constrained fuzzy possibilistic programming (RCFPP) model for water quality management within an agricultural system, where solutions for farming area, manure/fertilizer application amount, and livestock husbandry size under different scenarios are obtained and interpreted. Through improving upon the existing fuzzy possibilistic programming, fuzzy robust programming and chance-constrained programming approaches, the RCFPP can effectively reflect the complex system features under uncertainty, where implications of water quality/quantity restrictions for achieving regional economic development objectives are studied. By delimiting the uncertain decision space through dimensional enlargement of the original fuzzy constraints, the RCFPP enhances the robustness of the optimization processes and resulting solutions. The results of the case study indicate that useful information can be obtained through the proposed RCFPP model for providing feasible decision schemes for different agricultural activities under different scenarios (combinations of different p-necessity and pi levels). A p-necessity level represents the certainty or necessity degree of the imprecise objective function, while a pi level means the probabilities at which the constraints will be violated. A desire to acquire high agricultural income would decrease the certainty degree of the event that maximization of the objective be satisfied, and potentially violate water management standards; willingness to accept low agricultural income will run into the risk of potential system failure. The decision variables under combined p-necessity and pi levels were useful for the decision makers to justify and/or adjust the decision schemes for the agricultural activities through incorporation of their implicit knowledge. The results also suggest that this developed approach is applicable to many practical problems where fuzzy and probabilistic distribution information simultaneously exist.},

  abstract = {The challenge of improving water quality is a growing global concern, typified by the European Commission Water Framework Directive and the United States Clean Water Act. The main drivers of poor water quality are economics, poor water management, agricultural practices and urban development. This paper reviews the extensive role of non-point sources, in particular the outdated agricultural practices, with respect to nutrient and contaminant contributions. Water quality monitoring (WQM) is currently undertaken through a number of data acquisition methods from grab sampling to satellite based remote sensing of water bodies. Based on the surveyed sampling methods and their numerous limitations, it is proposed that wireless sensor networks (WSNs), despite their own limitations, are still very attractive and effective for real-time spatio-temporal data collection for WQM applications. WSNs have been employed for WQM of surface and ground water and catchments, and have been fundamental in advancing the knowledge of contaminants trends through their high resolution observations. However, these applications have yet to explore the implementation and impact of this technology for management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder's contributions, in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Here, the potential of WSN-controlled agricultural activities and different environmental compartments for integrated water quality management is presented and limitations of WSN in agriculture and WQM are identified. Finally, a case for collaborative networks at catchment scale is proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders (farming activities, water bodies) for integrated water quality monitoring, control and management.},
