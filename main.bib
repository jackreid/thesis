  abstract = {This paper introduces an approach to aircraft design and analysis that focuses on the evaluation of aircraft as multi-state systems, where a multi-state system is one having a finite set of performance levels or ranges, differentiated in this case by distinct levels of failure. In order to accurately examine numerous aircraft performance states, a multidisciplinary design model was used, consisting of an open-source 6-DoF flight simulator integrated with a vortex lattice aerodynamics solver and a MATLAB routine for calculation of weights and inertias. The primary impetus for using a flight simulator run in batch mode was to facilitate a global approach for concurrent analysis of aircraft expected performance and availability. Namely, by allowing systematic calculation of performance metrics for differing aircraft states, the relationship between an aircraft's global design variables and its performance and availability may be established. Such an approach allows designers to identify those elements that might drive system loss probability through an analysis of performance changes across system states and their respective sensitivity to design variables.},

This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

However, exploratory scenarios can be incorporated into planning practice in different ways, ranging from workshops among experts that aim to cultivate general learning to complex projects that result in highly detailed scenarios and recommendations for plans. Practitioners can draw on the cases we present to inspire planning methods for particular projects, taking into account specific contexts and goals.},

  abstract = {Mario Carpo provides a subtle and insightful discussion of the intellectual structures that guide architectural composition and the ways that these structures were transformed by the historic shifts from script to print and from hand-made drawings to mechanically reproduced images. He goes on to suggest that the current shift from print to digital representations will have similarly profound consequences. This is a crucial text for anyone interested in the interrelationships of media and design processes.                 As urban planning moves from a centralized, top-down approach to a decentralized, bottom-up perspective, our conception of urban systems is changing. In Cities and Complexity, Michael Batty offers a comprehensive view of urban dynamics in the context of complexity theory, presenting models that demonstrate how complexity theory can embrace a myriad of processes and elements that combine into organic wholes. He argues that bottom-up processes\textemdash in which the outcomes are always uncertain\textemdash can combine with new forms of geometry associated with fractal patterns and chaotic dynamics to provide theories that are applicable to highly complex systems such as cities.Batty begins with models based on cellular automata (CA), simulating urban dynamics through the local actions of automata. He then introduces agent-based models (ABM), in which agents are mobile and move between locations. These models relate to many scales, from the scale of the street to patterns and structure at the scale of the urban region. Finally, Batty develops applications of all these models to specific urban situations, discussing concepts of criticality, threshold, surprise, novelty, and phase transition in the context of spatial developments. Every theory and model presented in the book is developed through examples that range from the simplified and hypothetical to the actual. Deploying extensive visual, mathematical, and textual material, Cities and Complexity will be read both by urban researchers and by complexity theorists with an interest in new kinds of computational models.Sample chapters and examples from the book, and other related material, can be found at http://www.complexcity.info},

From this we show that a growing number of sovereign states are acquiring capacity for space based land-cover observations and show how geopolitical patterns of ownership are changing. We discuss how the number of satellites flying at any time has progressed as a function of increased launch rates and mission longevity, and how the spatial resolutions of the data they collect has evolved. The first such satellite was launched by the USA in 1972. Since then government and/or private entities in 33 other sovereign states and geopolitical groups have chosen to finance such missions and 197 individual satellites with a global land-cover observing capacity have been successfully launched. Of these 98 were still operating at the end of 2013. Since the 1970s the number of such missions failing within 3. years of launch has dropped from around 60\% to less than 20\%, the average operational life of a mission has almost tripled, increasing from 3.3. years in the 1970s to 8.6. years (and still lengthening), the average number of satellites launched per-year/per-decade has increased from 2 to 12 and spatial resolution increased from around 80. m to less than 1. m multispectral and less than half a meter for panchromatic; synthetic aperture radar resolution has also fallen, from 25. m in the 1970s to 1. m post 2007. More people in more countries have access to data from global land-cover observing spaceborne missions at a greater range of spatial resolutions than ever before. We provide a compendium of such missions, analyze the changes and shows how innovation, the need for secure data-supply, national pride, falling costs and technological advances may underpin the trends we document.},

  abstract = {The 2030 Agenda includes 17 overarching Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These are integrated in nature, and a principle of indivisibility should guide their implementation. Yet, the 2030 Agenda itself does not provide guidance on what indivisibility means in practice, how the SDGs interact, or on how to assess these interactions. The fast-emerging field of what could be referred to as SDG interaction studies seeks to provide such guidance, but as of yet there is no general agreement on what it means to take an integrated approach to the SDGs. Hence, navigating the diverse research landscape on SDG interactions might prove challenging. This paper aims to decipher the literature on SDG interactions by providing an overview of the current research, based on a sample of 70 peer-reviewed articles. The review explores four themes in SDG interaction research by mapping: (i) policy challenges typically addressed, (ii) ways in which SDG `interactions' have been conceptualized, (iii) data sources used, and (iv) methods of analysis frequently employed. Research gaps are identified, where perspectives largely missing include policy innovation, and integrated monitoring and evaluation. Further, few studies consider actor interactions, account for geographic spill-overs, analyze SDG indicator interactions, employ participatory methods, or take a whole-systems approach to the 2030 Agenda. Failing to address these gaps could lead to inefficient SDG implementation and delay goal attainment. Another contribution of the paper is a reading guide, proposing a way to decipher the literature along the themes emerging from the review, and offering a structure to code future papers.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.Surface water storage and fluxes in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and wetlands are currently poorly observed at the global scale, even though they represent major components of the water cycle and deeply impact human societies. In situ networks are heterogeneously distributed in space, and many river basins and most lakes\textemdash especially in the developing world and in sparsely populated regions\textemdash remain unmonitored. Satellite remote sensing has provided useful complementary observations, but no past or current satellite mission has yet been specifically designed to observe, at the global scale, surface water storage change and fluxes. This is the purpose of the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. SWOT is a collaboration between the (US) National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Centre National d'\'Etudes Spatiales (the French Spatial Agency), the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency, with launch planned in late 2020. SWOT is both a continental hydrology and oceanography mission. However, only the hydrology capabilities of SWOT are discussed here. After a description of the SWOT mission requirements and measurement capabilities, we review the SWOT-related studies concerning land hydrology published to date. Beginning in 2007, studies demonstrated the benefits of SWOT data for river hydrology, both through discharge estimation directly from SWOT measurements and through assimilation of SWOT data into hydrodynamic and hydrology models. A smaller number of studies have also addressed methods for computation of lake and reservoir storage change or have quantified improvements expected from SWOT compared with current knowledge of lake water storage variability. We also briefly review other land hydrology capabilities of SWOT, including those related to transboundary river basins, human water withdrawals and wetland environments. Finally, we discuss additional studies needed before and after the launch of the mission, along with perspectives on a potential successor to SWOT.},

Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what `research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.},

Martelli, Scenario building and scenario planning: state of the art and prospects of evolution, Futures Research Quarterly Summer (2001)). This is reflected in the fact that literature reveals an abundance of different and at times contradictory definitions, characteristics, principles and methodological ideas about scenarios. It has been suggested that a pressing need for the future of scenarios is amongst other things, to resolve the confusion over `the definitions and methods of scenarios'. This paper makes a beginning at this need by tracing the origins and growth of scenarios and the subsequent evolution of the various methodologies; a classification of the methodologies into three main schools of techniques is given and the salient features of these schools are compared and contrasted.},

But the dataset accumulated since December 1998 has provided the ideal raw material to test the mathematical laws underlying human travel, and that has important implications for the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Analysis of the trajectories of over half a million dollar bills shows that human dispersal is described by a `two-parameter continuous-time random walk' model: our travel habits conform to a type of random proliferation known as `superdiffusion'. And with that much established, it should soon be possible to develop a new class of models to account for the spread of human disease.},

A central weakness is the lack of communication between PSS developers (focusing on technical issues) and potential PSS users. Other academic fields such as knowledge management and technological innovation recognised similar bottlenecks years ago. On the basis of methods proposed in these fields, a new process architecture for the development of a PSS is proposed. Through a dialogue in which PSS developers and potential users discuss and use the PSS, existing tools, instruments, and models are refined and improved to be more useful to their potential users. The focus shifts away from the development of a technically more sophisticated support system, towards a process of PSS development which is intertwined with the planning process itself. This process architecture is called mediated planning support (MPS). We explore what can be learned from other academic domains and enquire about the applicability of these findings to PSS development. In Amsterdam the Department of Transport wanted to transform their transportation model into a land-use and transport PSS and their work illustrates how such a process architecture can link PSS developers and users in planning practice. We discuss the concepts behind MPS and use the case of Amsterdam to visualise its workings, lastly offering hypotheses on the method and suggestions for further research.},

The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30 m MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30 m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35 million km2 and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015. The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCD09CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11\%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 L1T and Sentinel-2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90\% for the HLS product are 6.2 m and 18.8 m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring.},

  abstract = {In 2011, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) identified the need for improved methods of performing early conceptual trade studies and lifecycle analysis to design systems effective in a wide range of situations and adaptable to many others. This surge in interest within the DoD has been driven by a recognition that as systems grow in scale and complexity, and consequently cost, traditional methods of addressing design and operational uncertainties will no longer suffice. These challenges, which are not unique to the DoD, can be more broadly characterized as the need to achieve sustained value delivery from systems despite perturbations in design, context or stakeholder needs. Epoch Era Analysis (EEA) was developed to better model problems with lifecycle uncertainties and has demonstrated its usefulness in prior research studies, but it still faces significant challenges to practical application. Specifically, EEA can result in large, multivariate datasets that are difficult to generate, visualize and perform analysis on. When performing exploratory analysis on such model-generated data sets, human interaction is often necessary to identify important subsets of the data, resolve ambiguity or find inconsistencies. Although prior research towards methods for applying EEA constructs has been performed, a prescriptive framework that explicitly considers human interaction does not exist. To make informed decisions, and design successful strategies for value sustainment, effective visualization and analysis techniques are needed to derive valuable insights from this data. These challenges motivate this thesis research.},

Project teams can improve results by recognizing that the future is inevitably uncertain and that by creating flexible designs they can adapt to eventualities. This approach enables them to take advantage of new opportunities and avoid harmful losses. Designers of complex, long-lasting projects\textemdash such as communication networks, power plants, or hospitals\textemdash must learn to abandon fixed specifications and narrow forecasts. They need to avoid the ``flaw of averages,'' the conceptual pitfall that traps so many designs in underperformance. Failure to allow for changing circumstances risks leaving significant value untapped. This book is a guide for creating and implementing value-enhancing flexibility in design. It will be an essential resource for all participants in the development and operation of technological systems: designers, managers, financial analysts, investors, regulators, and academics.The book provides a high-level overview of why flexibility in design is needed to deliver significantly increased value. It describes in detail methods to identify, select, and implement useful flexibility. The book is unique in that it explicitly recognizes that future outcomes are uncertain. It thus presents forecasting, analysis, and evaluation tools especially suited to this reality. Appendixes provide expanded explanations of concepts and analytic tools.},

It has also exposed a deep crisis in modeling and exposed a lack of systems thinking by focusing mainly on only the short term and thinking of this event as only a health crisis. In this paper, authors from several of the key countries involved in COVID-19 propose a holistic systems model that views the problem from a perspective of human society including the natural environment, human population, health system, and economic system. We model the crisis theoretically as a feedback control problem with delay, and partial controllability and observability. Using a quantitative model of the human population allows us to test different assumptions such as detection threshold, delay to take action, fraction of the population infected, effectiveness and length of confinement strategies, and impact of earlier lifting of social distancing restrictions. Each conceptual scenario is subject to 1000+ Monte-Carlo simulations and yields both expected and surprising results. For example, we demonstrate through computational experiments that maintaining strict confinement policies for longer than 60 days may indeed be able to suppress lethality below 1\% and yield the best health outcomes, but cause economic damages due to lost work that could turn out to be counterproductive in the long term. We conclude by proposing a hierarchical Computerized, Command, Control, and Communications (C4) information system and enterprise architecture for COVID-19 with real-time measurements and control actions taken at leach level.},

  abstract = {The ilities are properties of engineering systems that often manifest and determine value after a system is put into initial use (e.g. resilience, interoperability, flexibility). Rather than being primary functional requirements, these properties concern wider system impacts with respect to time and stakeholders. Over the past decade there has been increasing attention to ilities in industry, government and academia. Our research suggests that investigating ilities in sets may be more meaningful than study of single ilities in isolation. Some ilities are closely related and do in fact form semantic sets. Here, we use two methods to investigate over twenty ilities in terms of their prevalence and their interrelationships. We look for trends related to ilities of interest in relation to system type and an understanding of their collective use. First, we conducted a prevalence analysis of 22 ilities using both the internet as well as the Compendex/Inspec database as a source. We found over 1,275,000 scientific articles published between 1884 and 2010 and over 1.9 billion hits on the internet, exposing a clear prevalence-based ranking of ilities. Two questions we seek to address are: why and how are the ilities related to one another, and what can we do with this information. Initial steps to answer the first question include a 2-tupel-correlation matrix analysis that exposes the strongest relationships amongst ilities based on concurrent usage. Moreover, we conducted some preliminary experiments that indicate that a hierarchy of ilities with a few major groupings may be most useful. The overall objective for this research is to develop a formalframework and prescriptive guidance for effectively incorporating sets of ilities intothe design of complex engineering systems.},

By studying habit, impulse, and intelligence, he arrives at a morality that is firmly rooted the context of the world, accounting for thinking humans with individual circumstances that do, indeed, make a difference when determining right and wrong. Students of sociology, philosophy, and psychology will be interested to see moral judgment investigated as a scientific question by one of America's most influential philosophers.

Universality arises when the qualitative character of a system is sufficient to quantitatively predict its essential features, such as the exponents that characterize scaling laws. Within geomorphology, two areas where the concepts of scaling and universality have found application are the geometry of river networks and the statistical structure of topography. We begin this review with a pedagogical presentation of scaling and universality. We then describe recent progress made in applying these ideas to networks and topography. This overview leads to a synthesis that attempts a classification of surface and network properties based on generic mechanisms and geometric constraints. We also briefly review how scaling and universality have been applied to related problems in sedimentology\textemdash specifically, the origin of stromatolites and the relation of the statistical properties of submarine-canyon topography to the size distribution of turbidite deposits. Throughout the review, our intention is to elucidate not only the problems that can be solved using these concepts, but also those that cannot.},

It applies ``design thinking,'' but it goes beyond the borrowed tricks and techniques that usually characterize that term. Frame creation focuses not on the generation of solutions but on the ability to create new approaches to the problem situation itself.The strategies Dorst presents are drawn from the unique, sophisticated, multilayered practices of top designers, and from insights that have emerged from fifty years of design research. Dorst describes the nine steps of the frame creation process and illustrates their application to real-world problems with a series of varied case studies. He maps innovative solutions that include rethinking a store layout so retail spaces encourage purchasing rather than stealing, applying the frame of a music festival to understand late-night problems of crime and congestion in a club district, and creative ways to attract young employees to a temporary staffing agency. Dorst provides tools and methods for implementing frame creation, offering not so much a how-to manual as a do-it-yourself handbook\rule{1em}{1pt}a guide that will help practitioners develop their own approaches to problem-solving and creating innovation.},

Yet all too often, experts fix immediate problems without addressing the systematic oppression that created them. In The Tyranny of Experts, renowned economist William Easterly argues that the expert-approved, authoritarian approach to development has not only made little lasting progress, but has proven a convenient rationale for generations of human rights violations. Although aid agencies, such as the World Bank and the Gates Foundation, are still regarded as both well-meaning and effective, they're founded on the mistaken belief that wise technocrats from the West will be the saviors of helpless victims from the rest.This revised edition comes at a time of even greater peril for freedom worldwide. Easterly brings in new research that carries his masterful critiques into the present. He reveals the fundamental errors inherent in the long-celebrated top-down approach and offers a new model for developing countries-a model predicated on respect for the rights of poor people-with the power to end global poverty.},

The White Mans Burden is his widely anticipated counterpuncha brilliant and blistering indictment of the Wests economic policies for the worlds poor.

  abstract = {Modeling is essential to characterize and explore complex societal and environmental issues in systematic and collaborative ways. Socio-environmental systems (SES) modeling integrates knowledge and perspectives into conceptual and computational tools that explicitly recognize how human decisions affect the environment. Depending on the modeling purpose, many SES modelers also realize that involvement of stakeholders and experts is fundamental to support social learning and decision-making processes for achieving improved environmental and social outcomes. The contribution of this paper lies in identifying and formulating grand challenges that need to be overcome to accelerate the development and adaptation of SES modeling. Eight challenges are delineated: bridging epistemologies across disciplines; multi-dimensional uncertainty assessment and management; scales and scaling issues; combining qualitative and quantitative methods and data; furthering the adoption and impacts of SES modeling on policy; capturing structural changes; representing human dimensions in SES; and leveraging new data types and sources. These challenges limit our ability to effectively use SES modeling to provide the knowledge and information essential for supporting decision making. Whereas some of these challenges are not unique to SES modeling and may be pervasive in other scientific fields, they still act as barriers as well as research opportunities for the SES modeling community. For each challenge, we outline basic steps that can be taken to surmount the underpinning barriers. Thus, the paper identifies priority research areas in SES modeling, chiefly related to progressing modeling products, processes and practices.},

The OSSEs mimic the procedures used to analyze global observations for specifying states of the atmosphere. As simulations, however, OSSEs are not only confined to already existing observations and they provide a perfect description of the true state being analyzed. These two properties of the simulations can be exploited to improve both existing and envisioned observing systems and the algorithms to analyze them. Preliminary to any applications, however, the OSSE framework must be adequately validated. This first version of the simulated observations is drawn from a 13 month simulation of nature produced by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. These observations include simulated errors of both instruments and representativeness. Since the statistics of analysis and forecast errors are partially determined by these observational errors, their appropriate modelling can be crucial for validating the realism of the OSSE. That validation is performed by comparing the statistics of the results of assimilating these simulated observations for one summer month compared with the corresponding statistics obtained from assimilating real observations during the same time of year. The assimilation system is the three-dimensional variational analysis (GSI) scheme used at both the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and GMAO. Here, only statistics concerning observation innovations or analysis increments within the troposphere are considered for the validation. In terms of the examined statistics, the OSSE is validated remarkably well, even with some simplifications currently employed. In order to obtain this degree of success, it was necessary to employ horizontally correlated observation errors for both atmospheric motion vectors and some satellite observed radiances. The simulated observations with added observation errors appear suitable for some initial OSSE applications.},

Like the county poorhouse and scientific charity before them, digital tracking and automated decision-making hide poverty from the middle-class public and give the nation the ethical distance it needs to make inhumane choices: which families get food and which starve, who has housing and who remains homeless, and which families are broken up by the state.

  abstract = {To meet energy-reduction goals, cities are challenged with assessing building energy performance and prioritizing efficiency upgrades across existing buildings. Although current top-down building energy benchmarking approaches are useful for identifying overall efficient and poor performers across a portfolio of buildings at a city scale, they are limited in their ability to provide actionable insights regarding efficiency opportunities. Concurrently, advances in smart metering data analytics combined with new data streams available via smart metering infrastructure present the opportunity to incorporate previously undetectable temporal fluctuations into top-down building benchmarking analyses. This paper leveraged smart meter electricity data to develop daily building energy benchmarks segmented by strategic periods to quantify their variation from conventional, annual energy benchmarking strategies and investigate how such metrics can lead to near real-time energy management. The periods considered include occupied periods during the school year, unoccupied periods during the school year, occupied periods during the summer, unoccupied periods during the summer, and peak summer demand periods. Results showed that temporally segmented building energy benchmarks are distinct from a building's overall benchmark. This demonstrates that a building's overall benchmark masks periods in which a building is over- or underperforming during the day, week, or month; thus, temporally segmented energy benchmarks can provide a more specific and accurate measure for building efficiency. We discussed how these findings establish the foundation for digital twin\textendash enabled urban energy management platforms by enabling identification of building retrofit strategies and near-real-time efficiency in the context of the performance of an entire building portfolio. Temporally segmented energy benchmarking measures generated from smart meter data streams are a critical step for integrating smart meter analytics with building energy benchmarking techniques, and for conducting smarter energy management across a large geographic scale of buildings.},

Despite this increased importance, little is understood about how they influence policy priorities of key stakeholders, and their broader consequences. While quantification is the key strength of global goals, it also involves simplification, reification and abstraction, which have far-reaching implications for redefining priorities. This paper highlights the key findings and conclusions of the Power of Numbers Project, which undertook 11 case studies of the effects of selected MDG goals/targets, including both the empirical effects on policy priorities and normative effects on development discourses, and drew specifically on human rights principles and human development priorities. While the Project found that the effects varied considerably from one goal/target to another, all led to unintended consequences in diverting attention from other important objectives and reshaping development thinking. Many of the indicators were poorly selected and contributed to distorting effects. The Project concludes that target-setting is a valuable but a limited and blunt tool, and that the methodology for target-setting should be refined to include policy responsiveness in addition to data availability criteria.},

Perturbations/disruptions in CASoS bring with them the potential for far-reaching effects due to highly-saturated interdependencies and attendant vulnerabilities to cascades in associated systems. For example, the global effects of disruption within CASoS can be seen in the impacts of the Japanese earthquake/tsunami on not only the people and industry of Japan, but also on US car manufacturers, on global energy and financial markets, and on the future of nuclear power production around the world. We approach this sort of high-impact problem space as engineers, devising interventions or problem solutions that influence CASoS to achieve specific aspirations, an activity we call CASoS Engineering. Through application to real-world problems, the CASoS Engineering Initiative at Sandia National Laboratories is evolving CASoS Engineering principles while growing a community of practice and the CASoS engineers to populate it. The Initiative is both grounded in reality and works to extend our understanding and control of that reality; it is both a solution within a CASoS and a CASoS itself. We seek collaborators -engineers, problem holders, analysts, all those reaching for dynamic, adaptive solutions -to join in the evolution of the discipline of CASoS Engineering.},

  abstract = {Problem: Despite the widespread availability of geographic information systems (GIS) in local government, there is some evidence that the potential of GIS as a planning tool is not being fully exploited. While obstacles to GIS implementation in local government have been investigated, most of these investigations are either dated or do not focus on planning applications. Purpose: We aim to add to the limited literature on the current barriers hindering GIS use in public planning agencies. We also offer some insights into how to mitigate these barriers and help planning agencies move beyond using GIS simply for routine tasks of data access and mapmaking. Methods: We analyzed responses to a 2007 web-based survey of 265 practitioners in Wisconsin's public planning agencies and follow-up interviews with 20 practitioners we conducted in 2008. Results and conclusions: Planning departments still face a range of technological, organizational, and institutional barriers in using GIS. Training, funding, and data issues appear to be the most significant barriers preventing greater use of GIS for planning purposes, suggesting that organizational and institutional issues are more pertinent than technological barriers. Our literature review indicates that the barriers to GIS use in local government are similar to those of the past, but not identical. Furthermore, our observations indicate that, in general, practitioners are not aware of the full potential of GIS and planning support systems (PSS). Takeaway for practice: Increased funding alone is not likely to move a planning agency beyond routine applications of GIS. Improved access to training that is geared toward the planning process and planning applications may help alleviate many barriers planners face in using GIS in general and in incorporating more sophisticated GIS functions in their work. Research support: This work was supported in part by the Consortium for Rural Geospatial Innovations, funded by the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Services of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and in part by the University of Wisconsin\textendash Madison College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the University of Wisconsin\textendash Extension.},

Featuring vivid case studies highlighting the work of pioneers in New York, Boston, Chicago and more, the book provides a compelling model for the future of governance. The book will help mayors, chief technology officers, city administrators, agency directors, civic groups and nonprofit leaders break out of current paradigms to collectively address civic problems. The Responsive City is the culmination of research originating from the Data-Smart City Solutions initiative, an ongoing project at Harvard Kennedy School working to catalyze adoption of data projects on the city level. The book is co-authored by Professor Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart City Solutions at Harvard Kennedy School, and Professor Susan Crawford, co-director of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg penned the book's foreword. Based on the authors' experiences and extensive research, The Responsive City explores topics including:  Building trust in the public sector and fostering a sustained, collective voice among communities; Using data-smart governance to preempt and predict problems while improving quality of life; Creating efficiencies and saving taxpayer money with digital tools; and Spearheading these new approaches to government with innovative leadership.},

  abstract = {Maps are changing. They have become important and fashionable once more. Rethinking Maps brings together leading researchers to explore how maps are being rethought, made and used, and what these changes mean for working cartographers, applied mapping research, and cartographic scholarship. It offers a contemporary assessment of the diverse forms that mapping now takes and, drawing upon a number of theoretic perspectives and disciplines, provides an insightful commentary on new ontological and epistemological thinking with respect to cartography.  This book presents a diverse set of approaches to a wide range of map forms and activities in what is presently a rapidly changing field. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach to important contemporary mapping practices, with chapters written by leading theorists who have an international reputation for innovative thinking. Much of the new research around mapping is emerging as critical dialogue between practice and theory and this book has chapters focused on intersections with play, race and cinema. Other chapters discuss cartographic representation, sustainable mapping and visual geographies. It also considers how alternative models of map creation and use such as open-source mappings and map mash-up are being creatively explored by programmers, artists and activists. There is also an examination of the work of various `everyday mappers' in diverse social and cultural contexts.   This blend of conceptual chapters and theoretically directed case studies provides an excellent resource suited to a broad spectrum of researchers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in human geography, GIScience and cartography, visual anthropology, media studies, graphic design and computer graphics. Rethinking Maps is a necessary and significant text for all those studying or having an interest in cartography.},

Augmented deliberation, when properly designed, provides a powerful mechanism to enable productive and meaningful public deliberation. The article concludes with directions for further research.},

Design challenges include decentralized operation and management and socio-technical complexities not commonly addressed by modeling and simulation methods. This paper seeks to tackle these challenges by applying aspects of military wargaming to promote effective communication between decision-makers. A software architecture for federated simulation based on IEEE-1516 (HLA-Evolved) is presented in the context of multiple lunar in-situ resource production processes, resource depots, and intermediate transportation.

New design methods and tools to improve perception could reduce design effort. This paper extends an existing model of system project management to incorporate new methods for collaborative modeling and rapid sensitivity analysis using web-and browser-based technologies. A JavaScript-based API and model implementation in the system dynamics formalism replicate previous model results. Performance benchmarks demonstrate model execution in around 100 milliseconds on consumer hardware. Data storage and remote model execution services compose and query model results across executions. Browser-based user interfaces and visualizations allow users to interact with model components and provide batch model execution, tradespace exploration, sensitivity analysis, and time series comparison.},

Design and evolution of infrastructure systems seeks to reduce wasted resources and maximize lifecycle value. Interdependencies between constituent systems call for an integrative approach to improve interoperation but many existing techniques rely on centralized development and emphasize technical aspects of design. This paper presents a simulation gaming approach to collaborative infrastructure system design leveraging the technical strengths of simulation models and the social strengths of multi-player engagement in a game execution. In a strategic engineering game, models representing each constituent infrastructure system share a common graph-theoretic modeling framework and are integrated using the HLA-Evolved standard for interoperable federated simulations. A prototype game instantiation based on a space-based resource economy supporting future space exploration is discussed with the objective of identifying how factors of game play influence insights to collaborative system design. Future work seeks to develop, execute, and evaluate the prototype game to further research the use of simulation games in supporting collaborative system design.},

  abstract = {Maps are changing. They have become important and fashionable once more. Rethinking Maps brings together leading researchers to explore how maps are being rethought, made and used, and what these changes mean for working cartographers, applied mapping research, and cartographic scholarship. It offers a contemporary assessment of the diverse forms that mapping now takes and, drawing upon a number of theoretic perspectives and disciplines, provides an insightful commentary on new ontological and epistemological thinking with respect to cartography.  This book presents a diverse set of approaches to a wide range of map forms and activities in what is presently a rapidly changing field. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach to important contemporary mapping practices, with chapters written by leading theorists who have an international reputation for innovative thinking. Much of the new research around mapping is emerging as critical dialogue between practice and theory and this book has chapters focused on intersections with play, race and cinema. Other chapters discuss cartographic representation, sustainable mapping and visual geographies. It also considers how alternative models of map creation and use such as open-source mappings and map mash-up are being creatively explored by programmers, artists and activists. There is also an examination of the work of various `everyday mappers' in diverse social and cultural contexts.   This blend of conceptual chapters and theoretically directed case studies provides an excellent resource suited to a broad spectrum of researchers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in human geography, GIScience and cartography, visual anthropology, media studies, graphic design and computer graphics. Rethinking Maps is a necessary and significant text for all those studying or having an interest in cartography.},

This recognition brings with it the richness of many well-developed theories and methods from economics, operations research, decision sciences, and other disciplines. Done correctly, it forces the process of engineering design into a total systems context, and demands that design decisions account for a product's total life cycle. It also provides a theory of design that is based on a rigorous set of axioms that underlie value theory. But the rigor of decision-based design also places stringent conditions on the process of engineering design that eliminate popular approaches such as Quality Function Deployment. This paper presents the underlying notions of decision-based design, points to some of the axioms that underlie the theory of decision-based design, and discusses the consequences of the theory on engineering education.},

The North-on-top convention, for world maps especially, probably originated with the Greek scientist-geographer Claudius Ptolemy. World maps with North at the top were easier to study. The most obviously "dynamic" of map symbols are the oriented, or directional, ones such as the concentric circles and arrows drawn on the German maps to indicate the pressures of Einkreisung constraint and the counterforces of a Durchbruch strategy. Not only Harrison's standard-projection maps but also his wonderful bird's-eye-view, or perspective, maps of the various theaters of Second World War demonstrated brilliantly the virtues of cartographic agility.},

Alisha Holland demonstrates that this forbearance towards activities such as squatting and street vending is a powerful strategy for attracting the electoral support of poor voters. In many developing countries, state social programs are small or poorly targeted and thus do not offer politicians an effective means to mobilize the poor. In contrast, forbearance constitutes an informal welfare policy around which Holland argues much of urban politics turns. While forbearance offers social support to those failed by their governments, it also perpetuates the same exclusionary welfare policies from which it grows.},

In this instance, how can we be sure that the decision is the correct one, not just decided by the group with the most political influence or most money? Such groups have now become fundamental decision-making units within and between organisations in most societies and are more often than not very complex structures. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Groupware can be used in several practical contexts to make sure that spatial decision problems are overcome in the most effective way.A fundamental aspect of a spatial decision problem is the matter of location. The complexity of spatial decision problems result from the multiplicity of stakeholders involved, their often conflicting interests, and the intangible variables of the decision environment. Examples of such problems include: where to locate a public facility, which brownfield redevelopment strategy to choose, which sites to select for environmental restoration, or which comprehensive land use plan to adopt. Good solutions to such problems -if they exist at all- are characterised by a certain minimum level of secretarial support; hence the decision-making process should involve experts, citizens, and interest groups alike. Such a collaborative approach to spatial decision-making needs methodology, tools, and application examples to inspire its adoption and more widespread use. This book sets out the key to the collaborative spatial decision-making approach: its theoretical basis, the requisite tools, and a number of application examples.GIS professionals and researchers should find this an invaluable guide to an emerging area of GIS},

The decision-making process, involving policy priorities, trade-offs, and uncertainties, can be aided by Multiple Criteria Decision making (MCDM) methods. This paper presents a framework for integrating geographical information systems (GIS) and MCDM methods. In this framework the MCDM methods are classified and matched with choice heuristics used by the decision-makers in the presence of competing alternatives and multiple evaluation criteria. Two strategies for integrating GIS with MCDM are proposed. The first strategy suggests linking GIS and MCDM techniques using a file exchange mechanism. The second strategy suggests integrating GIS and MCDM functions using a common database.

  abstract = {The design and implementation of effective environmental policies need to be informed by a holistic understanding of the system processes (biophysical, social and economic), their complex interactions, and how they respond to various changes. Models, integrating different system processes into a unified framework, are seen as useful tools to help analyse alternatives with stakeholders, assess their outcomes, and communicate results in a transparent way. This paper reviews five common approaches or model types that have the capacity to integrate knowledge by developing models that can accommodate multiple issues, values, scales and uncertainty considerations, as well as facilitate stakeholder engagement. The approaches considered are: systems dynamics, Bayesian networks, coupled component models, agent-based models and knowledge-based models (also referred to as expert systems). We start by discussing several considerations in model development, such as the purpose of model building, the availability of qualitative versus quantitative data for model specification, the level of spatio-temporal detail required, and treatment of uncertainty. These considerations and a review of applications are then used to develop a framework that aims to assist modellers and model users in the choice of an appropriate modelling approach for their integrated assessment applications and that enables more effective learning in interdisciplinary settings.},

Some Americans insist that we're living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and well in America--it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit. In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis. As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial inequities. In shedding light on this history, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope. Praise for Stamped from the Beginning: "We often describe a wonderful book as 'mind-blowing' or 'life-changing' but I've found this rarely to actually be the case. I found both descriptions accurate for Ibram X. Kendi's Stamped from the Beginning... I will never look at racial discrimination again after reading this marvellous, ambitious, and clear-sighted book." - George Saunders, Financial Times, Best Books of 2017 "Ambitious, well-researched and worth the time of anyone who wants to understand racism." - Seattle Times "A deep (and often disturbing) chronicling of how anti-black thinking has entrenched itself in the fabric of American society." - The Atlantic - Winner of the 2016 National Book Award for Nonfiction- A New York Times Bestseller- A Washington Post Bestseller- Finalist for the 2016 National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction- Named one of the Best Books of the Year by the Boston Globe, - Washington Post, Chicago Review of Books, The Root, Buzzfeed, Bustle, and Entropy},

Unlike externally evoked crises, proactively constructed internal crises present a clear performance gap, shift learning orientation from imitation to innovation, and increase the intensity of effort in organizational learning. Such crisis construction is an evocative and galvanizing device in the personal repertoires of proactive top managers.

The promise and possibilities of debunking and retooling cartography are significant: by opening up who can make a map and the kinds of maps that are made, overlooked phenomena can be reclaimed, different perspectives can be made apparent, and new knowledge constructed. However, the conditions under which the emancipatory potential of critical cartography might be realized need to be investigated. This article critiques the claims that current new mapping practices increase participation and democracy and outlines four issues critical cartography needs to further develop in order to increase its potential: 1) greater reflexivity on the critical cartographer's own position and influence of the project, 2) acknowledgement of the choices made of what not to include in the map, 3) greater consideration about the politics of aesthetics, 4) expanded search for deeper social engagement with new mapping projects. The article also discusses these issues through a case study map project of street vendors contesting the use of sidewalk space in Ho Chi Minh City. It explores the qualities a non-participatory, authored map project might engender critical visualization through processes of spatial ethnography.},

While flood protection measures may reduce the frequency of inundation losses, appropriate preparedness measures lessen the residual financial risk considerably. Besides public and private measures, insurance is a key factor in reducing the financial risk for individuals, enterprises, and even whole societies. In recent years, the demand for flood insurance has been growing. This is forcing the insurance industry to develop appropriate solutions. At the same time it is vital for the insurers to know the probable maximum losses they might face as the result of an extreme event.}

The data flows that condition much of our lives now regularly include Global Positioning System (GPS) readings and satellite images of a quality once reserved for a few militaries and intelligence agencies, and powerful geographic information system (GIS) software is now commonplace. These new technologies have raised fundamental questions about the intersection between physical space and its representation, virtual space and its realization. In Close Up at a Distance, Laura Kurgan offers a theoretical account of these new digital technologies of location and a series of practical experiments in making maps and images with spatial data. Neither simply useful tools nor objects of wonder or anxiety, the technologies of GPS, GIS, and satellite imagery become, in this book, the subject and the medium of a critical exploration. Close Up at a Distance records situations of intense conflict and struggle, on the one hand, and fundamental transformations in our ways of seeing and of experiencing space, on the other. Kurgan maps and theorizes mass graves, incarceration patterns, disappearing forests, and currency flows in a series of cases that range from Kuwait (1991) to Kosovo (1999), New York (2001) to Indonesia (2010). Using digital spatial hardware and software designed for military and governmental use in reconnaissance, secrecy, monitoring, ballistics, the census, and national security, Kurgan engages and confronts the politics and complexities of these technologies and their uses. At the intersection of art, architecture, activism, and geography, she uncovers, in her essays and projects, the opacities inherent in the recording of information and data and reimagines the spaces they have opened up.},

We describe the Cynefin framework, a sense-making device we have developed to help people make sense of the complexities made visible by the relaxation of these assumptions. The Cynefin framework is derived from several years of action research into the use of narrative and complexity theory in organizational knowledge exchange, decision making, strategy and policy making. The framework is explained, its conceptual underpinnings are outlined, and its use in group sense-making and discourse is described. Finally, the consequences of relaxing the three basic assumptions, using the Cynefin framework as a mechanism, are considered. Over the past several years our group has been conducting a program of disruptive action research using the methods of narrative and of complexity theory to address critical business issues (see e.g., Snowden 1999b). We started work in the areas of knowledge management, cultural change and community dynamics; expanded into product development, market creation and branding; and have in recent years been working increasingly in the area of national and organizational strategy. Some of this work has been directly funded by the U.S. government through DARPA as well as by other government agencies, in particular in Singapore, which are interested in new approaches to supporting policy making. The central element of our approach is the Cynefin framework for sense-making. In this paper we will describe the framework and its conceptual basis, and we will detail some of its uses for sense-making to support decision making in varied dynamical contexts.},

  abstract = {Demand for mangrove forest resources has led to a steady decline in mangrove area over the past century. Land conversions in the form of agriculture, aquaculture and urbanization account for much of the deforestation of mangrove wetlands. However, natural processes at the transition zone between land and ocean can also rapidly change mangrove spread. In this study, we applied a robust field-based carbon inventory and new structural and temporal remote sensing techniques to quantify the magnitude and change of mangrove carbon stocks in major deltas across Africa and Asia. From 2000\textendash 2016, approximately 1.6\% (12 270 ha) of the total mangrove area within these deltas disappeared, primarily through erosion and conversion to agriculture. However, the rapid expansion of mangroves in some regions during this same period resulted in new forests that were taller and more carbon-dense than the deforested areas. Because of the rapid vertical growth rates and horizontal expansion, new mangrove forests were able to offset the total carbon losses of 5 332 843 Mg C by 44\%. Each hectare of new mangrove forest accounted for {$\sim$}84\% to {$\sim$}160\% of the aboveground carbon for each hectare of mangrove forest lost, regardless of the net change in mangrove area. Our study highlights the significance of the natural dynamics of erosion and sedimentation on carbon loss and sequestration potential for mangroves over time. Areas of naturally regenerating mangroves will have a much larger carbon sequestration potential if the rate of mangrove deforestation of taller forests is curbed.},

The next chapter is a unique tour of spatial queues, combining geometrical probability concepts with models of queues from previous chapters. The core of the chapter is development of the Hypercube Queueing model, a model that -- 31 years after its original development -- remains the gold standard in modeling municipal emergency services such as police, emergency medical and fire departments. The homework problems at the end of this chapter are the most challenging in the book, many worthy of the most advanced doctoral students. The book then shifts slightly from primarily probabilistic models to a combination of probabilistic and deterministic models, focusing on transportation networks analysis. This graph-focused chapter develops rigorous results by intuitive visual arguments, not abstract algebraic theorem proving. It too is a stand-alone chapter, the longest and most comprehensive in the book. There follows a brief chapter on the theory and mechanics of Monte Carlo simulation. This is good material even for people who use packaged simulation software, as it focuses on fundamentals and issues to think about even when using packaged software. The book concludes with a unique chapter on implementation, based on the personal experiences of the authors and their students in attempting to implement the models, methods and philosophies of the book.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces an enhancement of a cellular automata (CA) model by integrating system dynamics (SD) to incorporate household dynamics and housing decisions as driving forces of residential development. CA macro-models used to simulate the quantitative land-use change (LUC) for urban areas are, thus far, lacking profound dynamics driven by demographic change. The model presented in this paper focuses on household dynamics according to the concept of the second demographic transition (SDT), applying aging and population shrinkage to simulate respective effects on residential choice and the resulting LUC. Such a perspective becomes especially important for urban areas exhibiting growth and shrinkage simultaneously, as currently seen in cities in Europe and in the U.S. To analyze this simultaneity in detail, we implement the residential land use CA model Metronamica and apply it to Berlin's metropolitan region, which was selected as a typical example that displays contrasting growth and shrinkage processes. The pre-implemented macro-model has been replaced with our new SD model H2DCA (Household Decision Dynamics for Cellular Automata). For the simulation, we used empirical census data, economic data, data on residential satisfaction and numerous types of geo-information representing land-use zoning, accessibility and suitability for the time span 1990\textendash 2008. A comparison of a null model (NM) and H2DCA provides a very satisfying reproduction of land-use patterns reflected by kappa coefficient values. The causal relation of LUC drivers is considerably improved by sophisticated housing choice-feedback mechanisms. Although specific residential land-use classes exhibit shrinkage, others expand. Due to the detailed residential land-use classification, current re-urbanization processes could also be simulated.},

Instead, they readily found civilian applications in both the private and public sector. City planning and management were no exception. Jennifer Light argues that the technologies and values of the Cold War fundamentally shaped the history of postwar urban America. From Warfare to Welfare documents how American intellectuals, city leaders, and the federal government chose to attack problems in the nation's cities by borrowing techniques and technologies first designed for military engagement with foreign enemies. Experiments in urban problem solving adapted the expertise of defense professionals to face new threats: urban chaos, blight, and social unrest. Tracing the transfer of innovations from military to city planning and management, Light reveals how a continuing source of inspiration for American city administrators lay in the nation's preparations for war.},

In particular, we assume consumers purchase these solar panels according to a discrete choice model. The technology adoption process is reinforced by network externalities such as imitating customer behavior and cost improvements through learning-by-doing. Using this model, we develop a framework for policy makers to find optimal subsidies in order to achieve a desired adoption target with minimum cost for the system. We discuss the structure of the optimal subsidy policy and how the overall system cost changes with the adoption target. Furthermore, we validate the model through an empirical study of the German solar market, where we estimate the model parameters, generate adoption forecasts and demonstrate how to solve the policy design problem. We use this framework to show that the current policies in Germany are not efficient. In particular, our study suggests that their subsidies should be higher in the near future and the gradual phase-out of the subsidies should occur faster. History : First draft},

There are two aspects to this problem: 1) distinguishing between Engineering Systems (the term we use) and other Systems, and 2) differentiating among Engineering Systems. Engineering Systems are found to be differentiated from other complex systems by being human-designed and having both significant human complexity as well as significant technical complexity. As far as differentiating among various engineering systems, it is suggested that functional type is the most useful attribute for classification differentiation. Information, energy, value and mass acted upon by various processes are the foundation concepts underlying the technical types.},

The book provides a practical, heuristic approach to the "art" of systems architecting. It provides methods for embracing, and then taming, the growing complexity of modern systems. New in the Third Edition:   Five major case studies illustrating successful and unsuccessful practices Information on architecture frameworks as standards for architecture descriptions New methods for integrating business strategy and architecture and the role of architecture as the technical embodiment of strategy Integration of process guidance for organizing and managing architecture projects Updates to the rapidly changing fields of software and systems-of-systems architecture Organization of heuristics around a simple and practical process model  ~A Practical Heuristic Approach to the Art of Systems Architecting Extensively rewritten to reflect the latest developments, the text explains how to create a system from scratch, presenting invention/design rules together with clear explanations of how to use them. The author supplies practical guidelines for avoiding common systematic failures while implementing new mandates. He uses a heuristics-based approach that provides an organized attack on very ill-structured engineering problems. Examining architecture as more than a set of diagrams and documents, but as a set of decisions that either drive a system to success or doom it to failure, the book provide methods for integrating business strategy with technical architectural decision making.},

Instead, multiple plausible futures need to be considered, which requires (i) uncertainties to be described with the aid of scenarios that represent coherent future pathways based on different sets of assumptions, (ii) system performance to be represented by metrics that measure insensitivity (i.e. robustness) to changes in future conditions, and (iii) adaptive strategies to be considered alongside their more commonly used static counterparts. However, while these factors have been considered in isolation previously, there has been a lack of discussion of the way they are connected. In order to address this shortcoming, this paper presents a multidisciplinary perspective on how the above factors fit together to facilitate the development of strategies that are best suited to dealing with a deeply uncertain future.},

It explores approaches and tools supporting the design of strategic plans under deep uncertainty, and their testing in the real world, including barriers and enablers for their use in practice. The book broadens traditional approaches and tools to include the analysis of actors and networks related to the problem at hand. It also shows how lessons learned in the application process can be used to improve the approaches and tools used in the design process. The book offers guidance in identifying and applying appropriate approaches and tools to design plans, as well as advice on implementing these plans in the real world. For decisionmakers and practitioners, the book includes realistic examples and practical guidelines that should help them understand what decisionmaking under deep uncertainty is and how it may be of assistance to them. Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty: From Theory to Practice is divided into four parts. Part I presents five approaches for designing strategic plans under deep uncertainty: Robust Decision Making, Dynamic Adaptive Planning, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways, Info-Gap Decision Theory, and Engineering Options Analysis. Each approach is worked out in terms of its theoretical foundations, methodological steps to follow when using the approach, latest methodological insights, and challenges for improvement. In Part II, applications of each of these approaches are presented. Based on recent case studies, the practical implications of applying each approach are discussed in depth. Part III focuses on using the approaches and tools in real-world contexts, based on insights from real-world cases. Part IV contains conclusions and a synthesis of the lessons that can be drawn for designing, applying, and implementing strategic plans under deep uncertainty, as well as recommendations for future work.The publication of this book has been funded by the Radboud University, the RAND Corporation, Delft University of Technology, and Deltares.},

  author = {Martin, Pierre-alain J Y},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {The motivation for this work is to quantify the complexity of complex systems and to understand its sources. To study complexity, we develop a theoretical framework where the complex system of interest is embedded in a broader system: a complex large-scale system. In order to understand and show how the complexity of the system is impacted by the complexity of its environment, three layers of complexity are defined: the internal complexity which is the complexity of the complex system itself, the external complexity which is the complexity of the environment of the system (i.e., the complexity of the largescale system in which the system is embedded) and the interface complexity which is defined at the interface of the system and its environment. For each complexity we suggest metrics and apply them to two examples. The examples of complex systems used are two surveillance radars: the first one is an Air Traffic Control radar, the second one is a maritime surveillance radar. The two large-scale systems in which the radars are embedded are therefore the air and the maritime transportation system. The internal complexity metrics takes into account the number of links, the number of elements, the function and hierarchy of the elements. The interface complexity metric is based upon the information content of the probability of failure of the system as it is used in its environment. The External complexity metric deals with the risk configuration of largescale systems emphasizing the reliability and the tendency to catastrophe of the system. The complexity metrics calculated based on specific analysis of the ATC radar are higher than those calculated for the maritime radar for all the three levels of complexity indicating that the external complexity is the source for the internal complexity. Thus, not surprisingly it appears that the technical complexity of a system mainly stems from the socio-political complexity of the large-scale system in which it is embedded. More interestingly, the more rigorous and quantitative complexity metrics (Internal and Interface) are approximately linearly related for these two systems. This result is potentially important enough to be tested over a wider variety of complex systems.},

IUMs have been criticized over this same period on both practical and theoretical grounds. At the same time, continuing and very significant technological developments have made possible the development, implementation and use of such models in operational planning settings in various countries worldwide. A major review of the IUM state of the art and recommendations for evolution of this state were prepared by the author and colleagues 20 years ago. This paper presents an update of the 1998 report in terms of a summary of progress over the past 20 years, a critical assessment of the current IUM state of the art and practice, and needs and prospects for future development. This paper argues that the current modeling state is in "the doldrums," similar to concerns raised by Pas in the seminal 1990 critique of activity-based travel models. It then outlines research and development needs to exploit current and emerging data, computing, and methodological developments that hold promise for the development of a much more powerful and useful "next generation" of IUMs.},

  abstract = {The MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change is an organization for research, independent policy analysis, and public education in global environmental change. It seeks to provide leadership in understanding scientific, economic, and ecological aspects of this difficult issue, and combining them into policy assessments that serve the needs of ongoing national and international discussions. To this end, the Program brings together an interdisciplinary group from two established research centers at MIT: the Center for Global Change Science (CGCS) and the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR). These two centers bridge many key areas of the needed intellectual work, and additional essential areas are covered by other MIT departments, by collaboration with the Ecosystems Center of the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) at Woods Hole, and by short-and long-term visitors to the Program. The Program involves sponsorship and active participation by industry, government, and non-profit organizations. To inform processes of policy development and implementation, climate change research needs to focus on improving the prediction of those variables that are most relevant to economic, social, and environmental effects. In turn, the greenhouse gas and atmospheric aerosol assumptions underlying climate analysis need to be related to the economic, technological, and political forces that drive emissions, and to the results of international agreements and mitigation. Further, assessments of possible societal and ecosystem impacts, and analysis of mitigation strategies, need to be based on realistic evaluation of the uncertainties of climate science. This report is one of a series intended to communicate research results and improve public understanding of climate issues, thereby contributing to informed debate about the climate issue, the uncertainties, and the economic and social implications of policy alternatives. Titles in the Report Series to date are listed on the inside back cover. Abstract The electric power sector, which accounts for approximately 40\% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, will be a critical component of any policy the U.S. government pursues to confront climate change. In the context of uncertainty in future policy limiting emissions, society faces the following question: What should the electricity mix we build in the next decade look like? We can continue to focus on conventional generation or invest in low-carbon technologies. There is no obvious answer without explicitly considering the risks created by uncertainty. This research investigates socially optimal near-term electricity investment decisions under uncertainty in future policy. It employs a novel framework that models decision-making under uncertainty with learning in an economy-wide setting that can measure social welfare impacts. Specifically, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the U.S. is formulated as a two-stage stochastic dynamic program focused on decisions in the electric power sector. In modeling decision-making under uncertainty, an optimal electricity investment hedging strategy is identified. Given the experimental design, the optimal hedging strategy reduces the expected policy costs by over 50\% compared to a strategy derived using the expected value for the uncertain parameter; and by 12-400\% compared to strategies developed under a perfect foresight or myopic framework. This research also shows that uncertainty has a cost, beyond the cost of meeting a policy. Results show that uncertainty about the future policy increases the expected cost of policy by over 45\%. If political consensus can be reached and the climate science uncertainties resolved, setting clear, long-term policies can minimize expected policy costs. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that near-term investments in low-carbon technologies should be greater than what would be justified to meet near-term goals alone. Near-term low-carbon investments can lower the expected cost of future policy by developing a less carbon-intensive electricity mix, spreading the burden of emissions reductions over time, and helping to overcome technology expansion rate constraints-all of which provide future flexibility in meeting a policy. The additional near-term cost of low-carbon investments is justified by the future flexibility that such investments create. The value of this flexibility is only explicitly considered in the context of decision-making under uncertainty.},

This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas.  Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.To request a copy of the Solutions Manual, visit: http://global.oup.com/uk/academic/physics/admin/solutions},

  abstract = {The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom uses institutional analysis to explore different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the 'tragedy of the commons' argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

Many examples from a variety of cultures are presented. These range from the impact of snowmobiles in North America to the use of water pumps in rural India, and from homemade toys in Africa to electricity generation in Britain-all showing how the complex interaction of many influences in every community affects technological practice. Arnold Pacey, who lives near Oxford, England, has a degree in physics and has lectured on both the history of technology and technology policy, with a particular focus on the development of technologies appropriate to Third World needs.

A significant number of models have been developed in a variety of disciplines (computer graphics, robotics, evacuation dynamics, etc.). This paper presents a review of crowd simulation models and selected commercial software tools for high rise building evacuation simulation. The commercial tools selected (STEPS and EXODUS) are grid-based simulations, which allow for efficient implementation but introduce artifacts in the final results. This paper focuses on describing the main challenges and limitation of these tools, in addition to explaining the importance of incorporating human psychological and physiological factors into the models. The paper concludes with an overview of fundamentals that should be applied to simulate human movement closer to real movements of people, where interaction between bodies emerges and flow rates, densities, and speeds become the result of those interactions instead of some predefined value.}

The objective of the research is to improve the ability of systems engineers to anticipate and manage the effects of changing requirements. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a model for quantifying the impact of requirements volatility on systems engineering effort that can be incorporated into the Constructive Systems Engineering Cost Model. Based on a review of the literature and expert judgment collected through surveys in five workshops, we identify five observations that summarize the key considerations of requirements volatility. First, a set of project organizational, technical, and contextual factors were ranked by subject matter experts in terms of their influence on requirements volatility. Their responses point to poor initial understanding of the system and customer needs as the leading cause of requirements volatility. Second, our results suggest that, while volatility tends to decrease over time, the number of requirements changes may increase during transitions between life cycle phases. Third, requirements volatility increases the functional size of the project and causes rework of engineering products, driving an increase in systems engineering effort. Fourth, the effect of requirements volatility on systems engineering effort increases the later the change occurs in the system life cycle. Fifth, the effort impact of a requirements change varies depending on the type of change (added, deleted, and modified).},

  abstract = {Conservation tools have historically been oriented toward optimization for singular decision-makers. A new generation of participatory tools is now appearing and have begun to recognize multiple human values and decision-makers. However, very few tools accommodate a fully interactive process that can account for both ecological and social dynamism and complexity. The Collaborative Habitat Investment Atlas (CHIA) is a participatory tool for conservation prioritization with a strong visual and dynamic capability. The CHIA promotes interaction among stakeholders through two aspects: stakeholders' ability to alter variable weights to reflect different biodiversity protection requirements; and formula-based dynamic attributes that immediately update results visually. This paper documents the development of the CHIA within its role as a part of an overall adaptive community-based natural resource management pilot project in Australia's globally significant humid tropical forests. There are two primary innovations of this approach. The first innovation is the dynamic updating of values and other data, allowing rapid feedback on ``what-if?'' type questions and enhances the public engagement processes. The second innovation is the recognition and spatial description of different levels of protection across the landscape. Results include parcel-based maps that display the three models: biodiversity importance, level of protection and threat. Additionally, the three models were combined and two examples of suitability maps to aid conservation decision-making are included. When integrated into a conservation planning process the CHIA opens lines of communication, allows exploration of alternatives and enables prioritization of investment that captures the diversity of stakeholder preferences in multiple social decision making contexts.},

  abstract = {Complex international partnerships have emerged as a policy instrument of choice for many governments to build domestic capacity in science, technology and innovation with the help of foreign partners. At present, these flagship initiatives tend to be primarily practitioner-driven with limited systematic understanding of available design options and trade-offs. Here, we present an analysis of four such partnerships from the university sector between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and governments in the UK, Portugal, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore. Using a system architecture approach in conjunctions with in-depth case studies and elements of interpretive policy analysis, we map how in each country distinct capacity-building goals, activities, and political and institutional contexts translate into different partnership architectures: a bilateral hub-\&-spokes architecture (UK), a consortium architecture (Portugal), an institution-building architecture (Abu Dhabi), and a functional expansion architecture (Singapore). Despite these differences in emergent macro-architectures, we show that each partnership draws on an identical, limited set of 'forms' that can by organized around four architectural views (education, research, innovation \& entrepreneurship, institution-building) and four levels of interaction between partners (people, programs/projects, objects, organization/process). Based on our analysis, we derive a design matrix that can help guide the development future partnerships through a systematic understanding of available design choices. Our research underscores the utility and flexibility of complex international partnerships as systemic policy instruments. It suggests a greater role for global research universities in capacity-building and international development, and emphasizes the potential of targeted cross-border funding. Our research also demonstrates the analytic power of system architecture for policy analysis and design. We argue that architectural thinking provides a useful stepping stone for STS-type interpretive policy analysis into national innovation initiatives in different political cultures, as well as more custom-tailored approaches to program evaluation.},

An alternative perspective is proposed in which animals are regarded as a marginal `social' group discursively constituted and practically affected by human communities, and as a group which is thereby subjected to all manner of sociospatial inclusions and exclusions, The argument is that animals should be seen as enmeshed in complex power relations with human communities, and in the process enduring geographies which are imposed upon them `from without' but which they may also inadvertently influence `from within'. The implications of adopting such a perspective require careful examination, but in the second part of this paper some possibilities are raised though substantive vignettes of animals as a social group included in or excluded from the city. Particular attention is paid to 19th-century debates about meat markets and slaughterhouses, wherein can be detected a will to exclude livestock animals from cities such as London and Chicago on a variety of grounds (medical and hygienic, organisational and moral).},

Rethinking Maps brings together leading researchers to explore how maps are being rethought, made and used, and what these changes mean for working cartographers, applied mapping research, and cartographic scholarship. It offers a contemporary assessment of the diverse forms that mapping now takes and, drawing upon a number of theoretic perspectives and disciplines, provides an insightful commentary on new ontological and epistemological thinking with respect to cartography.  This book presents a diverse set of approaches to a wide range of map forms and activities in what is presently a rapidly changing field. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach to important contemporary mapping practices, with chapters written by leading theorists who have an international reputation for innovative thinking. Much of the new research around mapping is emerging as critical dialogue between practice and theory and this book has chapters focused on intersections with play, race and cinema. Other chapters discuss cartographic representation, sustainable mapping and visual geographies. It also considers how alternative models of map creation and use such as open-source mappings and map mash-up are being creatively explored by programmers, artists and activists. There is also an examination of the work of various `everyday mappers' in diverse social and cultural contexts.   This blend of conceptual chapters and theoretically directed case studies provides an excellent resource suited to a broad spectrum of researchers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in human geography, GIScience and cartography, visual anthropology, media studies, graphic design and computer graphics. Rethinking Maps is a necessary and significant text for all those studying or having an interest in cartography.},

  abstract = {There are benefits to be gained from combining the strengths of modeling frameworks that capture social, environmental and design-based considerations. Many of the important challenges of the next decade lie at the intersection of the natural environment, human decision making and the design of space technology to inform decision making. There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals outlined by the United Nations through 2030. Several of these Sustainable Development Goals can be addressed by asking: 1) What is happening in the natural environment? 2) How will humans be impacted by what is happening in the natural environment? 3) What decisions are humans making in response to environmental factors and why? and 4) What technology system can be designed to provide high quality information that supports human decision making? The answers to these questions are often interrelated in complex ways; thus it is helpful to use a framework from complex systems to integrate these questions. Within the list of Sustainable Development Goals, several fit the three questions above, including \#2 Zero Hunger, \#6 Clean Water and Sanitation, \#13 Climate Action, \#14 Life Below Water, and \#15 Life on Land. This paper presents a research agenda to apply environmental modeling, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering to inform the design of space systems in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. This work builds on previous research in the following areas: 1) physics-based environmental modeling; 2) complex systems modeling to simulate human decision making using agent-based models; and 3) model based systems engineering to inform the architecture of satellites or space-enabled data systems. This paper presents a review of the state of the art, shows examples of how these methods have been combined to inform space system design and presents a future research agenda. As an example, the paper discusses a project related to Sustainable Development Goal \#15 to design an earth observation system using space-based and ground-based data collection regarding an invasive plant species in Benin, West Africa. In this example, insights are needed regarding natural variables (i.e. salinity, temperature and turbidity of local waterways), social variables (i.e. economic impact of the invasive plant on local communities), and design variables (i.e. the technical performance of existing imagery satellites and in-situ sensor networks).},

However, there is little guidance on how to assess, systematically, the extent to which a system is complex. The main objective of this study is to carry out a systematic analysis of a SAMU (Mobile Emergency Medical Service) Medical Regulation Center in Brazil, based on the core characteristics of complex systems presented by previous studies. The assessment was based on direct observations and nine interviews: three of them with regulator of emergencies medical doctor, three with radio operators and three with telephone attendants. The results indicated that, to a great extent, the core characteristics of complexity are magnified) due to basic shortcomings in the design of the work system. Thus, some recommendations are put forward with a view to reducing unnecessary complexity that hinders the performance of the socio-technical system.},

Additionally, insights have been made in applications to more complex cases, such as analyzing policy effects on system cost and performance, as well as understanding the time-dependent effects of architecture and design choices for spiral development.

This approach falls short when designing systems that are capable of delivering sustained value to stakeholders in the face of a rapidly changing world. In order to achieve this value robustness, systems should be designed using natural value-centric time scales, as defined by their contexts, for conceptualizing system timelines. Epoch-Era Analysis is an approach that provides for visualization and a structured way to think about the temporal system value environment. This paper discusses Epoch-Era Analysis as central to a tradespace exploration process for system design comparison and selection, invoking passive or active value robustness design strategies. The analysis can also serve as a socio-technical bridge, integrating the tradespace exploration activities of architects and engineers, which may be traditionally independent efforts in contemporary engineering programs.},

Identical particles hop from site to site on a regular lattice, obeying simple conservative scattering rules when they collide. Remarkably, at a scale larger than the lattice spacing, these discrete models simulate the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid mechanics. This book addresses three important aspects of lattice gases. First, it shows how such simple idealised microscopic dynamics give rise to isotropic macroscopic hydrodynamics. Second, it details how the simplicity of the lattice gas provides for equally simple models of fluid phase separation, hydrodynamic interfaces, and multiphase flow. Lastly, it illustrates how lattice-gas models and related lattice-Boltzmann methods have been used to solve problems in applications as diverse as flow through porous media, phase separation, and interface dynamics.

In this major new work he presents a compelling and practical framework for how global citizens can use a holistic way forward to address the seemingly intractable worldwide problems of persistent extreme poverty, environmental degradation, and political-economic injustice: sustainable development. Sachs offers readers, students, activists, environmentalists, and policy makers the tools, metrics, and practical pathways they need to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Far more than a rhetorical exercise, this book is designed to inform, inspire, and spur action. Based on Sachs's twelve years as director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, his thirteen years advising the United Nations secretary-general on the Millennium Development Goals, and his recent presentation of these ideas in a popular online course, The Age of Sustainable Development is a landmark publication and clarion call for all who care about our planet and global justice.

However, recent developments in desktop geographic information systems, combined with the devolution of social programs to the local level, have created the technology and the need for such indicators. In the history of indicator use, five lessons for neighborhood indicators stand out. First, it is imperative that the numbers have a specific policy purpose. Second, geographic indicators play a special role, more important than that of subject area indicators, because policy is administered through geographic units and because neighborhoods and cities themselves affect the quality of people's lives. Third, one must from the outset distinguish clearly between indicators that measure neighborhood well-being and indicators that measure the well-being of neighborhood residents. Fourth, to be most useful, indicators must be unbundled, that is, not tied to an overall index. Finally, the movement to use geographic indicators, especially on the neighborhood scale, is in its infancy. Neighborhood-level indicators are just beginning to be used to make and evaluate policy, and to search for the causes of change in neighborhoods and in the lives of their residents.},

The VIIRS instrument carries two separate sets of multi-spectral channels providing full global coverage at both 375. m and 750. m nominal resolutions every 12. h or less depending on the latitude. In this study, we introduce a new VIIRS active fire detection algorithm, which is driven primarily by the 375. m middle and thermal infrared imagery data. The algorithm builds on the well-established MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies product using a contextual approach to detect both day and nighttime biomass burning and other thermal anomalies. Here we present the fire algorithm's design and implementation, including important information describing the input data characteristics and potential artifacts associated with pixel saturation and the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly, both found to affect the middle infrared channel data. Initial assessment using results derived from the global processing of the algorithm indicated small, although variable, commission errors ({$<$} 1.2\%) for nominal confidence fire pixels. We achieved improved performance using the 375. m active fire data compared to the VIIRS 750. m baseline fire product, resulting in a 3. ?? and 25. ?? factor increase in the absolute number of fire pixels detected using day and nighttime data, respectively. Similarly, VIIRS 375. m fire data showed significantly superior mapping capabilities compared to current MODIS fire detection data with improved consistency of fire perimeter delineation for biomass burning lasting multiple days. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In so doing, the study's findings contribute to pressing policy issues such as social exclusion. Seven counties of the Louisville, Kentucky-Indiana MSA serve as the study area for the investigation. Data are derived from three sources: a geocoded travel diary survey, a geocoded database of all opportunities in the area, and a database of shortest-path travel times. Accessibility indices (gravity, cumulative opportunity, and proximity) are defined for 34 types of opportunities: four aggregate types and 30 disaggregate types representing the 10 most popular destinations for trips for each of the first three aggregate types. These indices are computed for households that responded to the trip-diary survey. Non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests are used to compare the levels of accessibility experienced by five socio-economic groups (i.e., individuals residing in rural communities, individuals residing in single-person and single-parent households, individuals residing in low-income households, women, and the elderly) to counterpart groups. Except for individuals residing in rural areas, the findings of this study indicate that groups conventionally considered to be at risk of social exclusion are not disadvantaged in terms of accessibility.},

  author = {Selva Valero, Daniel Selva},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {System architecting is concerned with exploring the tradespace of early, high-level, system design decisions with a holistic, value-centric view. In the last few years, several tools and methods have been developed to support the system architecting process, focusing on the representation of an architecture as a set of interrelated decisions. These tools are best suited for applications that focus on breadth - i.e., enumerating a large and representative part of the architectural tradespace -as opposed to depth - modeling fidelity. However, some problems in system architecting require good modeling depth in order to provide useful results. In some cases, a very large body of expert knowledge is required. Current tools are not designed to handle such large bodies of knowledge because they lack scalability and traceability. As the size of the knowledge base increases, it becomes harder: a) to modify existing knowledge or add new knowledge; b) to trace the results of the tool to the model assumptions or knowledge base. This thesis proposes a holistic framework for architecture tradespace exploration of large complex systems that require a large body of expert knowledge. It physically separates the different bodies of knowledge required to solve a system architecting problem (i.e., knowledge about the domain, knowledge about the class of optimization or search problem, knowledge about the particular instance of problem) by using a rule-based expert system. It provides a generic population-based heuristic algorithm for search, which can be augmented with rules that encode knowledge about the domain, or about the optimization problem or class of problems. It identifies five major classes of system architecting problems from the perspective of optimization and search, and provides rules to enumerate architectures and search through the architectural tradespace of each class. A methodology is also defined to assess the value of an architecture using a rule-based approach. This methodology is based on a decomposition of stakeholder needs into requirements and a systematic comparison between system requirements and system capabilities using the rules engine. The framework is applied to the domain of Earth observing satellite systems (EOSS). Three EOSS are studied in depth: the NASA Earth Observing System, the NRC Earth Science Decadal Survey, and the Iridium GEOscan program. The ability of the framework to produce useful results is shown, and specific insights and recommendations are drawn.},

While the initial attempt was to integrate all models as tightly as possible, the authors developed a much more agile integration approach that allows adding and replacing individual modules easily. Python wrappers were developed to loosely couple land use, land cover, transportation, and emission models developed in different environments. ArcGIS Model Builder was used to provide a graphical user interface and to present the models' workflow. The suggested approach is especially efficient when the models are developed in different programming languages, their source codes are not available, or the licensing restrictions make other coupling approaches impractical.},

A framework for types of complexity is proposed that includes three types of structural complexity (size, connectivity, and architecture), two types of dynamic complexity (short-term and long-term), and one additional type, socio-political complexity. These types cover most of the characteristics of complexity mentioned in the reviewed literature; omissions are noted. It would be advantageous to identify specific measures of complexity so that the complexity of systems or development programs could be compared and tracked, and risks could be identified and mitigated. To this end an overview of systems engineering measurement is provided, followed by a discussion of how complexity types might be able to be measured. At this point, however, a composite measurement of the six types of complexity is not recommended.},

As systems and the enterprises in which they are developed become increasingly complex, systems engineering as learned and taught in the twentieth century should be supplemented by principles learned in the new sciences of complexity and chaos. Awareness of complexity theory can help practicing engineers perform their tasks differently on projects, in ways ranging from understanding the problem space and making models of the environment early in the life cycle, through managing changing requirements, designing differently, and identifying and managing risks, to supporting changing project management approaches. In addition, a science of complex systems engineering is being formed. This involves developing a formal theoretical backdrop for the heuristics that systems engineers have experientially found effective in architecting and developing complex systems. Complexity theory is enriching efforts to develop this advanced system engineering approach and practices.},

  abstract = {In city planning contexts, hypermedia systems have been demonstrated to be engaging tools that make complex information understandable to those who are not technically sophisticated. This is accomplished through the use of multimedia interfaces that use images, motion, and sound as representational aids. Hypermedia also affords associative linking which allows one to organize and browse related information in a manner similar to encyclopedic cross-referencing. Many of the early applications of these systems have been hampered by computing platform dependence and an inability to form associative links with remotely accessible information. The issue of connectivity with remotely accessible information has recently been addressed through the maturation of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). This makes it possible for the globally networked community to access this information in an associative manner. In this paper I will reflect on the relevance of the WWW to multimedia-based collaborative planning systems (CPS), drawing upon two examples from the National Capital Planning Commission in Washington, DC. Some of the initial benefits and drawbacks of the distributed approach to geographic hypermedia systems will be reviewed.},

Sustainability concerns along the environmental and financial dimensions have motivated focus on waste and emissions reduction, new technology development, and greening of industrial ecosystems. The concept of inclusive development, however, has not yet permeated the research or conceptualization of sociotechnical systems. Two streams of on-going work in inclusive innovation and in inclusive wealth analysis offer meaningful avenues for future connections. We discuss how the literature on sociotechnical systems and their constituent elements of engineered products and processes has evolved on the topic of sustainability, how the emerging concept of inclusive innovation bridges dimensions of environment and social inclusivity, and how inclusive wealth may inform system-level planning and analysis of sociotechnical systems moving forward.}

Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly extralegal property arrangements, such as squatting on large estates, to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth.

We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately \$370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly (\$55,000\textendash\$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.},

  abstract = {The term complexity is used in many different ways in the systems domain. The different uses of this term may depend upon the kind of system being characterized, or perhaps the disciplinary perspective being brought to bear. The purpose of this paper is to gather and organize different views of complexity, as espoused by different authors. The purpose of the paper is not to make judgments among various complexity definitions, but rather to draw together the richness of various intellectual perspectives about this concept, in order to understand better how complexity relates to the concept of engineering systems. I have either quoted directly or done my best to properly paraphrase these ideas, apologizing for when I have done so incorrectly or in a misleading fashion. I hope that this paper will be useful as we begin to think through the field of engineering systems. The paper concludes with some short takes -- pungent observations on complexity by various scholars -- and some overarching questions for subsequent discussion},

  abstract = {This paper explores the potential for interaction between the development of geographic information systems (GIS) and the development of geographical methodology in the next decade. Several interrelated themes occur throughout the paper: first, trends in the nature and extent of GIS development; second, opportunities for geographic investigation inherent in those developments; and third, contributions that geographers can make to the design of GIS It is suggested that GIS offer a wealth of geo-referenced data for potential use in modeling, as well as the capabilities to handle such data in geographical models. Geographers, in turn, can contribute to GIS design in ways that will enhance their capabilities and also facilitate geographical investigations. The incorporation of the quantitative geographical methods of the 1950s and 1960s with the GIS capabilities of the 1990s is foreseen This article's fourth theme is the concern over the critical shortage of trained persons competent in GIS technology and possessing a knowledge of spatial analytic methods. This may in itself be the limiting factor to the rational development of the field in the next decade. Suggestions are made for the types of training needed to remedy the problem. The fifth theme is the view of GIS from a global perspective, including the role of Canadian geographers in analysing global problems similar to those they face in Canada It is suggested that a convergence of the technologies for the gathering, storage, analysis, and display of georeferenced data occurring at local, regional, national multinational, and global scales has a potential in the next decade for an enriched geographical methodology Dans cet article, on explore les possibilit\'es dinteractions entrp l'\'elaboration des syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique et celle des m\'ethodes g\'eographiques au cours de la prochaine d\'ecennie. Plusieurs th\`emes \'etroitement li\'es reviennent dans l'article. D'abord, on peut distinguer certaines orientations dans la nature et la port\'ee de l'\'evolution des syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique. Ensuite, il en ressort que quelques unes d'entre-elles pourraient faire l'objet d'enqu\^etes g\'eographiques. Troisi\`emement, plusieurs contributions pourraient \^etre apport\'ees par les g\'eographes \`a la conception des syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique. Les syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique sont une importante source de donn\'ees \`a r\'ef\'erence g\'eographique pouvant \^etre adapt\'es \`a la mod\'elisation, et ils comportent de fortes capacit\'es de manipulation de ces donn\'es dans des rnod\`eles g\'eographiques. Les g\'eographes, \`a leur tour, peuvent contribuer \`a la conception de ces syst\`emes de fa\c{c}on \`a augmenter leurs habilit\'es, et en m\^eme temps, faciliter les enqu\^etes g\'eographiques. On pr\'evoit l'incorporation des m\'ethodes g\'eographiques quantitatives des ann\'ees cinquante et soixante aux capacit\'es des syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique des ann\'ees quatre-vingt-dix. Le quatri\`eme motif tient \`a l'inqui\'etude que suscite la p\'enurie critique de personnel comp\'etent dans la technologie des syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique ainsi que dans les m\'ethodes d'analyse spatiale. Cette p\'enurie pourrait imposer des limites au d\'eveloppement rationnel de ce domaine au cours de la prochaine d\'ecenpie. On propose des types de formation pour rem\'edier \`a ce probl\`eme. Le cinqui\`eme motif porte sur la perspective des syst\`emes d'information g\'eographique du point de vue mondial, et du r\^ole des g\'eographes canadiens dans ce dornaine en \'evolution, qui conna\^it des probl\`emes semblables \`a ceux qu'on rencontre au Canada. On sugg\`ere une convergence technologique dans la collecte, l'entreposage, l'analysk et l'\'etalage des donn\'ees a r\'ef\'erence g\'eographique aux niveaux local, r\'egional, national, pluri-national et mondial offrant des possibilit\'es d'enrichissement des m\'ethodes g\'eographiques au cours de la prochaine d\'ecennie.},

  abstract = {Historically, multipurpose land information systems have often been designed for use as community-wide enterprises. Before becoming useful to the community, however, many of these systems encounter prohibitive factors delaying or preventing the satisfaction of the ultimate goals for which they were designed. A criticism of current models is that system developers seeking to build publicly accessible systems do not use them. Since most systems are developed without the guidance of a formal model, system developers often do not fully anticipate likely system issues. Many systems, designed on an ad hoc basis, fail to achieve their full potential, because they have not used an appropriate model to determine a final system outcome. This paper presents a theoretical model describing the stages systems experience during development. These stages are: no development, system initiation, database development, recordkeeping, analysis, and democratization. Additionally, the factors promoting or prohibiting movement from one stage to the next, and the indicators or outcomes of each stage are described. Not only are the individual elements described but also their relationships are described as part of the model. The Multipurpose Land Information System (MPLIS) development model is designed both as a guide for system developers and a tool for discussing and comparing systems.},

Here, she illuminates our present search for authentic connection in a time of uncharted challenges. Turkle has spent a career composing an intimate ethnography of our digital world; now, marked by insight, humility, and compassion, we have her own.In this vivid and poignant narrative, Turkle ties together her coming-of-age and her pathbreaking research on technology, empathy, and ethics. Growing up in postwar Brooklyn,Turkle searched for clues to her identity in a house filled with mysteries. She mastered the codes that governed her mother's secretive life. She learned never to ask about her absent scientist father--and never to use his name, her name. Before empathy became a way to find connection, it was her strategy for survival.Turkle's intellect and curiosity brought her to worlds on the threshold of change. She learned friendship at a Harvard-Radcliffe on the cusp of coeducation during the antiwar movement, she mourned the loss of her mother in Paris as students returned from the 1968 barricades, and she followed her ambition while fighting for her place as a woman and a humanist at MIT. There, Turkle found turbulent love and chronicled the wonders of the new computer culture, even as she warned of its threat to our most essential human connections. The Empathy Diaries captures all this in rich detail--and offers a master class in finding meaning through a life's work.},

Collaborative modeling is an increasingly-used approach to enable effective science-based decision-making. This work evaluates the modeling process conducted for two hydropower dam licensing negotiations, to explore how differences in the collaborative development of hydrological models affected differences in their use in subsequent decision-making. In one case, the model was developed iteratively through deliberation with stakeholders. Consequently, stakeholders understood the model and its limitations and trusted the model and modelers; the model itself was also better designed to evaluate resource managers' questions. The collaboratively-developed model became the focal point for subsequent negotiations and enabled creative group problem-solving. Conversely, in the case with less engagement during model development, the model was not used subsequently by decision-makers. These differences are argued to result from trust built during the modeling process, applicability of the model to test real management scenarios, and the broader social context in which the models were used.},

  abstract = {This is the fourth edition of Avrom Bendavid-Val's classic book that has become a standard for practitioners and students of public administration, urban and regional planning, and regional economics. Last revised in 1983, the work now provides a comprehensive practitioner-oriented study of the state of the art of regional and local economic development planning, with emphasis on specific project activity arrived at through an analysis of the regional economic context. The book is written in a straightforward style, free of technical terms and jargon, and is suitable for readers without an extensive background in economics, mathematics, or statistics. In addition, all analytical work is presented in a form that can be carried out without the use of vast databases or computers.Bendavid-Val divides his work into five basic parts, each covering a different feature or method of analysis and planning. Part one introduces important aspects of the overall economic and development context within which the methods of regional analysis are used. Parts two, three, and four offer an introduction to common descriptive methods of analysis for use in regional planning, covering aggregate regional analysis, intraregional analysis, and project identification and evaluation. Finally, part five deals with approaches to regional development planning, providing help in selecting the methods that will be most useful in a given situation. A selected bibliography concludes the book. This work contains everything the practitioner or student needs in order to understand what regional and local economic development is all about, as well as to acquire the basic analytical skills for regional development planning, and to design and carry out a regional development planning process. Public and academic libraries will find this updated and expanded edition to be a significant addition to their collections, and for students and practitioners in regional planning and development, it will be an essential reference source.},

  abstract = {The modern warfighter operates in an environment that has dramatically evolved in sophistication and interconnectedness over the past half century. With each passing year, the infusion of ever more complex technologies and integrated systems places increasing burdens on acquisition officers to make decisions regarding potential programs with respect to the joint capability portfolio. Furthermore, significant cost overruns in recent acquisition programs reveal that, despite efforts since 2010 to ensure the affordability of systems, additional work is needed to develop enhanced approaches and methods. This paper discusses research that builds on prior work that explored system design tradespaces for affordability under uncertainty, extending it to the program and portfolio level. Time-varying exogenous factors, such as resource availability, stakeholder needs, or production delays, may influence the potential for value contribution by constituent systems over the lifecycle of a portfolio, and make an initially attractive design less attractive over time. This paper introduces a method to conduct portfolio design for affordability by augmenting Epoch-Era Analysis with aspects of Modern Portfolio Theory. The method is demonstrated through the design of a carrier strike group portfolio involving the integration of multiple legacy systems with the acquisition of new vessels.},

In this article we question if following a socio-technical method in PSS development could lead to PSS with better functionality and usability than following a traditional systems engineering method, as is sometimes suggested in literature. The former method involves close cooperation with users, whereas the latter does not. This article describes an empirical study of this question. The article describes the development, application and evaluation of two PSS for sketch planning, one developed by following the traditional systems engineering method and the other by following the socio-technical method. The PSS integrate drawing and sketching with basic geographic information system functionality and use an innovative hardware interface called Maptable. The evaluation results show that the traditionally developed PSS was immediately rejected by planning practitioners due to poor functionality and usability, whereas the PSS developed with a socio-technical approach was much more acceptable. Intense cooperation with users in agreement with the socio-technical method appeared to improve the analysis of planning tasks and user needs, leading to a PSS with a sophisticated and dedicated architecture. This PSS was considered more functional and usable than the traditionally developed PSS. In addition, the socio-technically developed PSS offers some benefits over conventional planning methods. In current state the PSS is suitable for use by professionals, and it is being further developed aiming to make it suitable for supporting collaborative planning with citizens.},

The Planners Guide to CommunityViz is the first book to explain how to support planning projects with CommunityViz, GIS-based software that planners around the world are using to help decision-makers, professionals, and the public visualize, analyze, and communicate about development proposals, future growth patterns, and the outcome of particular plans or developments. It shows the planner which tools and techniques to use and how to use them for maximum effectiveness on planning projects large and small. Full of practical examples and case studies, the book shows how CommunityViz can enliven the comprehensive planning process from visioning, to public participation, to values mapping, to build-out analysis. Chapters show how to use CommunityViz to analyze zoning regulations, calculate the costs of community services, and evaluate development proposals requiring design review. In addition, it is applicable to transportation planning, natural-resource planning, land-development suitability assessment, and urban economic development analysis.},

Now, it's increasingly about complex systems. As the airplane taxis to the gate, you access the Internet and check email with your PDA, linking the communication and transportation systems. At home, you recharge your plug-in hybrid vehicle, linking transportation to the electricity grid. Today's large-scale, highly complex sociotechnical systems converge, interact, and depend on each other in ways engineers of old could barely have imagined. As scale, scope, and complexity increase, engineers consider technical and social issues together in a highly integrated way as they design flexible, adaptable, robust systems that can be easily modified and reconfigured to satisfy changing requirements and new technological opportunities.Engineering Systems offers a comprehensive examination of such systems and the associated emerging field of study. Through scholarly discussion, concrete examples, and history, the authors consider the engineer's changing role, new ways to model and analyze these systems, the impacts on engineering education, and the future challenges of meeting human needs through the technologically enabled systems of today and tomorrow.},

  abstract = {The design of technical systems such as automobiles and spacecraft has traditionally focused exclusively on performance maximization. Many organizations now realize that such an approach must be balanced against competing objectives of cost, risk, and other criteria. If one is willing to give up some amount of performance relative to the best achievable performance level, one introduces slack into system design. This slack can be invested in creating better outcomes overall. One way to achieve this is to balance the requirements among contributing subsystems such that the number of active constraints is minimized, while still achieving the desired system performance. This paper introduces a methodology called ``isoperformance'' as a means of identifying and evaluating a performance-invariant set of design solutions, which are efficient in terms of other criteria such as cost, risk, and lifecycle properties. Isoperformance is an inverse design method that starts from a desired vector of performance requirements and works backwards to identify acceptable solutions in the design space. To achieve this, gradient-based contour following is implemented as a multivariable search algorithm that manipulates the null set of the Jacobian matrix. Use of the method is illustrated with two examples from spacecraft design and human performance in sports. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 9: 45\textendash 61, 2006},

  abstract = {The high cost of launching resources from the Earth's surface is a significant barrier to future longduration human space exploration. A future resource economy in space may allow resource production, processing, storage, and transportation at distributed locations, but will have many stakeholders with varied and potentially competing objectives. Simulation games provide a medium for communication and learning richer than papers or linear presentations by combining the technical capabilities of simulation models with human interaction. Building on technology powering military wargames, federated simulation architectures such as HLA-Evolved use independently-developed simulation models connected over a distributed network of computers. This paper presents an approach for developing a multi-player simulation gaming environment where human players take on roles of organizations or government agencies within scenarios designed to address the design and operation of a resource economy in space. The game design addresses the number of players, time advancement, level of abstraction, scenario selection, and other decisions based on past simulation games in the domains of military-political, educational, disaster response, and business-management games. Future research will focus on evaluating game executions to analyze human decision-making under various scenarios. Quantitative analysis of decisions using game logs combined with qualitative analysis of interviews and surveys will contribute to strategies for a future resource economy in space.},

Data for a set of US cities show that they have very similar fractal dimensions. The cellular approach makes it possible to achieve a high level of spatial detail and realism and to link the results directly to general theories of structural evolution.}

  abstract = {At the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of Europe's cities experienced a population decrease. Dealing with the results of demographic, economic and physical contraction processes and planning for the future of considerably smaller but nevertheless livable cities presents some of the most challenging tasks for urban Europe in the near future. This article highlights the example of Dresden in Eastern Germany, where the breakdown of the state-directed economy caused economic decline, industrial regression, and high unemployment rates. Due to out migration and decreasing birth rates, the city lost 60,000 of its 500,000 residents within one decade. As a consequence, there were housing and office vacancies as well as infrastructure oversupplies. Yet the administrative system was still directed towards growth objectives throughout the 1990s. Only after 2000 this situation changed dramatically. The new strategic plan for Dresden is no longer growth oriented. Instead, it focuses on a model of the compact `European city', with an attractive urban centre, reduced land consumption, and a stable population. However, in another unexpected turn of events, within the last seven years the city has experienced an unexpected growth of 25,000 residents. Surprisingly, processes of suburbanization have turned into processes of reurbanization. Today in Dresden, areas of shrinkage and decline are in close proximity to prospering and wealthy communities. The strategic challenge is to deal with this patchwork while accepting that the future remains unpredictable. Hence, strategic flexibility becomes more important than the strategy itself. To a certain extent rational analysis and error prevention is displaced by preparedness, robustness, and resilience as key qualifications of planning in shrinking cities. \textdagger I am grateful to the members of the Shrinking Cities International Research Network (SCiRNTM), in particular Sylvie Fol and Cristina Martinez-Fernandez, for instructive discussions on various aspects of shrinking cities and to anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions on an earlier draft.},

  abstract = {Maps are changing. They have become important and fashionable once more. Rethinking Maps brings together leading researchers to explore how maps are being rethought, made and used, and what these changes mean for working cartographers, applied mapping research, and cartographic scholarship. It offers a contemporary assessment of the diverse forms that mapping now takes and, drawing upon a number of theoretic perspectives and disciplines, provides an insightful commentary on new ontological and epistemological thinking with respect to cartography.  This book presents a diverse set of approaches to a wide range of map forms and activities in what is presently a rapidly changing field. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach to important contemporary mapping practices, with chapters written by leading theorists who have an international reputation for innovative thinking. Much of the new research around mapping is emerging as critical dialogue between practice and theory and this book has chapters focused on intersections with play, race and cinema. Other chapters discuss cartographic representation, sustainable mapping and visual geographies. It also considers how alternative models of map creation and use such as open-source mappings and map mash-up are being creatively explored by programmers, artists and activists. There is also an examination of the work of various `everyday mappers' in diverse social and cultural contexts.   This blend of conceptual chapters and theoretically directed case studies provides an excellent resource suited to a broad spectrum of researchers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in human geography, GIScience and cartography, visual anthropology, media studies, graphic design and computer graphics. Rethinking Maps is a necessary and significant text for all those studying or having an interest in cartography.},

  abstract = {Each year billions of animals are poisoned, dissected, displaced, killed for consumption, or held in captivity\textemdash usually for the benefit of humans. The animal world has never been under greater peril and this broad-ranging collection contributes to a much-needed, fundamental rethinking about our relation with it.  Animal Geographies explores the diverse ways in which animals shape the formation of human identity. Essays on zoos and wolves, for example, reveal how animals figure in social constructions of race, gender, and nationality. From questions of identity and subjectivity, it moves to a consideration of the places where people and animals confront the realities of coexistence on an everyday basis, by way of case studies of species such as mountain lions and the golden eagle. It then examines the ways in which animals figure in the ongoing globalization of production and mass consumption\textemdash illustrated by essays on the US meatpacking industry and meat production in the Indian state of Rajasthan\textemdash and finally, takes up legal and ethical approaches to human-animal relations.  Animal Geographies compels a profound rethinking of the nature of human-animal relations and offers a series of proposals for reconstituting this relationship on a progressive basis.

Countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are creating or reinvigorating national satellite programs. These countries are building local capability in space through technological learning. This paper analyzes implementation approaches in small satellite programs within developing countries. The study addresses diverse examples of approaches used to master, adapt, diffuse and apply satellite technology in emerging countries. The work focuses on government programs that represent the nation and deliver services that provide public goods such as environmental monitoring. An original framework developed by the authors examines implementation approaches and contextual factors using the concept of Systems Architecture. The Systems Architecture analysis defines the satellite programs as systems within a context which execute functions via forms in order to achieve stakeholder objectives. These Systems Architecture definitions are applied to case studies of six satellite projects executed by countries in Africa and Asia. The architectural models used by these countries in various projects reveal patterns in the areas of training, technical specifications and partnership style. Based on these patterns, three Archetypal Project Architectures are defined which link the contextual factors to the implementation approaches. The three Archetypal Project Architectures lead to distinct opportunities for training, capability building and end user services. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IAA.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the process of building technological capability in government-led satellite programs within developing countries. The key message is that these satellite programs can learn useful lessons from literature in the international development community. These lessons are relevant to emerging satellite programs that leverage international partnerships in order to establish local capability to design, build and operate satellites. Countries with such programs include Algeria, Nigeria, Turkey, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. The paper first provides background knowledge about space activity in developing countries, and then explores the nuances of the lessons coming from the international development literature. Developing countries are concerned with satellite technology because satellites provide useful services in the areas of earth observation, communication, navigation and science. Most developing countries access satellite services through indirect means such as sharing data with foreign organizations. More countries, however, are seeking opportunities to develop satellite technology locally. There are objective, technically driven motivations for developing countries to invest in satellite technology, despite rich debate on this topic. The paper provides a framework to understand technical motivations for investment in satellite services, hardware, expertise and infrastructure in both short and long term. If a country decides to pursue such investments they face a common set of strategic decisions at the levels of their satellite program, their national context and their international relationships. Analysis of past projects shows that countries have chosen diverse strategies to address these strategic decisions and grow in technological capability. What is similar about the historical examples is that many countries choose to leverage international partnerships as part of their growth process. There are also historical examples from outside the space arena in which organizations have pursued technological capability. Scholars have analyzed these examples and developed insightful frameworks. The paper draws key concepts from this literature about the nature of development, technology, knowledge and organizational learning. These concepts are relevant to learning in new satellite programs, but the ideas must be applied cautiously because of the nature of satellite technology. The paper draws three major lessons from the international development literature regarding absorptive capacity, tacit knowledge and organizational learning; it synthesizes these lessons into a cohesive, original framework. The closing section proposes future work on a detailed study of technological learning in specific government satellite programs. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The analysis is unfolded in three stages. The first stage introduces a framework called the Space Technology Ladder. This Ladder framework posits a path through four major technology categories, as follows: 1) establishing a national space agency; 2) owning and operating a satellite in low Earth orbit; 3) owning and operating a satellite in geostationary orbit; and 4) launching satellites. The second stage of the analysis uses data to create a graphical timeline, by mapping the historical achievements of the eight countries onto the Ladder framework. The results provide information about the similarities and differences in the technology strategies of the various countries. The third stage is a discussion of the strategic decisions faced by the countries under study. Exploring their diverse strategies is an initial step toward developing prescriptive theory to inform developing country space programs. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Space technology and resources are used around the world to address societal challenges. Space provides valuable satellite services, unique scientific discoveries, surprising technology applications and new economic opportunities. Many developing countries formally recognize the advantages of space resources and pursue national level activity to harness them. There is limited data or documentation on the space activities of developing countries. Meanwhile, traditional approaches to summarize national space activity do not necessarily capture the types of activity that developing countries pursue in space. This is especially true if they do not have a formal national space program or office. Developing countries pursue national space activity through activities of many types - from national satellite programs to commercial use of satellite services to involvement with international space institutions. This research aims to understand and analyze these trends. This paper introduces two analytical frameworks for evaluating space activity at the national level. The frameworks are specifically designed to capture the activity of countries that have traditionally been less involved in space. They take a broad view of space related activity across multiple societal sectors and disciplines. The discussion explains the approach for using the frameworks as well as illustrative examples of how they can be applied as part of a research process. The first framework is called the Mission and Management Ladders. This framework considers specific space projects within countries and ranks them on Ladders that measure technical challenge and managerial autonomy. This first method is at a micro level of analysis. The second framework is called the Space Participation Metric (SPM). The SPM can be used to assign a Space Participation score to countries based on their involvement in various space related activities. This second method uses a macro level of analysis. The authors developed both frameworks as part of a long term research program about the space activities of developing countries. This aspect of the research focuses on harnessing multiple techniques to summarize complex, multi-disciplinary information about global space activity. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Satellite technology in the areas of remote sensing, communication, and navigation can provide valuable information in a number of areas from business to disaster management to agriculture. There is great potential for such technology to help solve problems in developing countries. Unfortunately, due to lack of funds, expertise, equipment or awareness, developing countries are not using satellite technology to its full potential. This thesis is motivated by a desire to increase and improve the use of satellite-based technology in developing countries. Three Research Questions guide the study. Question 1 is, ``How does national development level relate to national space activity?'' For this question, national development level is measured by a series of Development Indicators such as Gross Domestic Product. The level of space activity is measured using a Space Participation Metric that is created by the author. Statistical analysis is used to learn if there is any significant difference in the space activity of countries at different development levels. Research Question 2 asks, ``What Mission and Management Architectures are developing countries using to apply satellite-based technology to national needs?'' The data used to answer this question comes from 90 Space Project Case Studies about satellite-enabled activities in Africa. The information from the Case Studies is organized so that trends can be found in the accomplishments of the projects. Research Question 3 asks, ``How does national development level influence the Mission and Management Architectures used by developing countries in satellite-based technology projects?'' This question builds on the data from Research Question 2. Statistical},

We combine our theoretical reasoning with a multiscale approach and with fractal-like argumentation which results in a frame of conditions which is supported by the outline of a theoretical conceptual simulation model which would also allow non-linear, iterative simulations of the urban space. The understanding of autonomous non-linear spatial development has a direct impact on planning. Addressing the underlying thinking behind Haken's synergetics we develop a framework within which the interdependencies between different levels of scale are key. We are aware that bottom-up and top-down processes often have a mutual influence on one another. We therefore propose a conceptual simulation model for planning where conditions have an impact at various levels of scale. In coherence with the idea of the `dynamic behaviour of the system after a planning decision was made', this feedback gives us information on the surviving and non-surviving planning scenarios and decisions and is reminiscent of systems which are open to self-organizing pattern formation. Our reasoning with regard to planning and decision-making and their multilevel consequences is strongly influenced by the arguments presented in complexity studies.},

In one conclusion the IPCC states that developing countries will be most vulnerable to climate change; in another, the TAR reports that we are unable to predict adaptive responses to site-specific exposures to climate impacts.  Here we explore how variation in adaptive capacity and climate impacts can be seen to influence the global distribution of vulnerability. We find that all countries will be vulnerable to climate change, even if their adaptive capacities are enhanced.  Developing nations are most vulnerable to modest climate change, and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions would diminish their vulnerabilities significantly.  Developed countries would benefit most from mitigation for moderate climate change. Extreme climate change overwhelms the abilities of all countries to adapt.},

Specifically, we examine whether geographic localities characterised by high percentages of socially vulnerable populations experience significantly more casualties due to flood events, adjusting for characteristics of the natural and built environment. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models indicate that the odds of a flood casualty increase with the level of precipitation on the day of a flood event, flood duration, property damage caused by the flood, population density, and the presence of socially vulnerable populations. Odds decrease with the number of dams, the level of precipitation on the day before a recorded flood event, and the extent to which localities have enacted flood mitigation strategies. The study concludes with comments on hazard-resilient communities and protection of casualty-prone populations. \textcopyright{} Overseas Development Institute, 2008.},

  abstract = {Nokou\'e Lake is a complex ecosystem, the understanding of which requires control of physical processes that have occurred. For this, the Surface Water Modeling System (SMS) hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated on the water depth data. The results of these simulations show a good match between the simulated and observed data for bottom roughness and turbulent exchange coefficients, of 0.02 m-1/3\textperiodcentered s and 20 m2/s respectively. Once the ability of the model to simulate the hydrodynamics of the lake is testified, the model is used to simulate water surface elevation, exchanged flows and velocities. The simulation shows that the tidal amplitude is maximum at the inlet of the channel and decreases gradually from the inlet towards the lagoon's main body. The propagation of the tidal wave is characterized by the dephasing and the flattening of the amplitude tide, which increases as we move away from the channel. This dephasing is characterized by a high and low tides delay of about 1 or 4 h and also depends on the tide amplitude and location. The velocities inside the lake are very low and do not exceed 0.03 m/s. The highest are obtained at the entrance of the channel. In a flood period, in contrast with the low-water period, incoming flows are higher than outflows, reinforced by the amplitude of the tide. An average renewal time of the lake has been estimated and corresponds during a flood period to 30 days for an average amplitude tide and 26.3 days on a high amplitude tide. In a low water period it is 40.2 days for an average amplitude tide and 30 days for a high amplitude tide. From the results obtained, several measures must be taken into account for the rational management of the lake water resources. These include a dam construction at the lake upstream, to control the river flows, and the dredging of the channel to facilitate exchanges with the sea.},

However, in adapting scenario planning from its origins in the business sector, planners have eliminated two key components: (1) the use of multiple scenarios, and (2) the inclusion of diverse organizations, people, and interests through deep deliberations. We argue that this shift limits the ability of planners to plan for multiple plausible futures that are shaped by an increasing number of diverse actors. In this paper, we use case-study research to examine how uncertainty was considered in four scenario-planning processes. We analyzed and compared the cases based on analytical categories related to multiple futures and diversity. We found that the processes that used multiple, structurally distinct scenarios explored a wider range of topics and issues shaping places. All four relied heavily on professional stakeholders as the scenario developers, limiting public input. Only one of the processes that included multiple futures captured the differential effects that scenarios would have on diverse people and interests. Overall, the purpose of the scenario planning drove the participant diversity and ultimately the quality and use of the scenarios.},
